The process for generating 28 HTML reports, including all embedded tables, was optimized for a "one-click" action. This automation has reduced generation time to under 10 seconds, significantly improving project workflow and reducing manual effort.

Just as a programmer thinks carefully about the logic, structure and sequence of events in the computer code that they write for machines to execute, you must now consider how your words can be parsed and understood by ChatGPT as it ponders how to answer you. This doesn’t mean you have to strip your wording of nuance or personality or interact with it in an overly formal or structured manner. But it does mean being mindful in avoiding ambiguity and building prompts with precision. Put another way, the more specific and detailed your prompts, the better ChatGPT can tailor its responses to meet your expectations.

Clear and specific instructions lead to better results. Providing detailed context and goals tends to render more accurate responses. ChatGPT also interprets your intent, so it’s best to be clear about that in the prompt too. Keep in mind that with either type of prompt, ChatGPT fills in gaps or makes assumptions about the information.

On one hand, you introduce key details and direct ChatGPT. On the other hand, overloading the prompt with too much data or excessively technical details can confuse the model and result in irrelevant responses. So the art in effective prompting lies in providing just enough data to inform and guide ChatGPT’s response without overshadowing your main question or request.
