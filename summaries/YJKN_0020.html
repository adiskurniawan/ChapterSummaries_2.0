Contractors and vendors paid through Accounts Payable are out of scope unless the contract explicitly treats payments as payroll — such arrangements must be documented and escalated to Tax/Legal.<br>Assumptions: integration or data exchange points exist between HR master system (HROS), time/effort capture, payroll engine and the general ledger (GL). Where integration is not present, equivalent manual controls and increased sampling are mandatory. This guide complements Chapter 9 — Staff Payroll and Benefits and is intended as the operational playbook for finance, HR and programme teams. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Staff Cost Allocation — Technical User Guide"> <strong>Governance & control principles — extended</strong><br>1. Accrual & matching: recognise payroll expense in the period staff provided services; match costs and funding to correct cost objects; ensure salaries, employer taxes and statutory charges are recorded consistently.<br>2. Segregation of duties: prepare, review/authorise, and pay must be distinct roles; enforce separation in system roles and bank authorization; rotate roles periodically to reduce fraud risk.<br>3. Principle of least PII exposure: present only necessary payroll detail to budget-holders; use anonymised dashboards and encrypted payroll packs; restrict access by role and certify periodically; log and review access patterns monthly.<br>4. Defence-in-depth controls: pre-flight validation, independent reviewer sign-off, dual payment sign-off and post-run reconciliation (control sheet ↔ bank ↔ GL); maintain an incident register for control failures.<br>5. Donor precedence and documentation: donor award terms take precedence on allocation and evidence requirements; where donor rules differ, document deviation analysis and approval in payroll pack and notify regional grants/compliance function. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Staff Cost Allocation — Technical User Guide"> <strong>Primary allocation methods — algorithms, formulas, examples & rules</strong><br><strong>Method A — FTE-based allocation</strong><br>Formula: Allocation% = (Assigned FTE to cost code / Employee FTE) × 100.<br>Worked example: 1.0 FTE; 0.6 to Project A, 0.4 to Admin; Gross USD 3,000 → Project A 1,800; Admin 1,200.<br>Rules: record default FTE in HROS; enforce change cut-off; require contract support if FTE changes frequently; reconcile FTE changes monthly to HR records.<br><strong>Method B — Time-based allocation (timesheets / effort reports)</strong><br>Formula: Allocation% = (Hours charged to cost code / Total paid hours) × 100.<br>Worked example: 160 paid hours; 40 hours to Project B → 25% → USD 600 if gross USD 2,400.<br>Rules: require contemporaneous capture, supervisor sign-off, donor templates where applicable, and electronic retention of timestamps; enforce minimum supporting granularity for donors (daily/weekly as specified).<br><strong>Method C — Fixed contractual split</strong><br>Formula: use contract-specified percentages.<br>Worked example: 70/30 split of gross USD 4,000 → HQ 2,800; Project 1,200.<br>Rules: store contract clause in master file and require HR sign-off for new contracts with non-standard splits; record effective dates and version history.<br><strong>Method D — Driver-based allocation</strong><br>Formula: Allocation% = (Driver units for project / Total driver units) × 100.<br>Worked example: beneficiary counts 120 vs 80 -> 60%/40% split. Apply only where driver reliably proxies effort; document driver source and extraction query; retain raw driver data and transformation logic for auditors.<br><strong>Method E — Hybrid</strong><br>Pattern: fixed core allocation + variable remainder (e.g., 50% fixed admin + 50% timesheet). Provide a worked example and include rounding rules and tie-breaker logic for cents; document the hybrid formula for each role where used. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Staff Cost Allocation — Technical User Guide"> <strong>Roles & responsibilities — RACI, signatures & evidence</strong><br><strong>HR:</strong> maintain master data, contracts, FTE and role-mapping; provide joiner/leaver notices by cut-off; maintain change logs and evidence of approvals for master data changes.<br><strong>Payroll preparer:</strong> construct payroll control sheet, apply allocation logic, run pre-flight checks, prepare GL upload preview, compile payroll pack draft and highlight exceptions.<br><strong>Budget-holder:</strong> validate and sign apportionment; provide effort evidence for donor-charged staff; retain evidence in local repository and attach to central payroll pack.<br><strong>Independent reviewer / CFD:</strong> perform arithmetic checks, sample verification, statutory tax check and final sign-off; escalate material exceptions to CD and document reviewer sampling methodology.<br><strong>Payments officer / Treasury:</strong> prepare bank file, enforce DoA dual sign-off, obtain bank confirmations (MT103/SWIFT) and provide files for archiving; validate new payee additions via bank positive-pay where available.<br><strong>Internal Audit / Compliance:</strong> periodic testing, control effectiveness reviews, and follow-up on high-risk exceptions; maintain audit trail of findings and remediation status.<br>Evidence required: electronic approver proof (email/DocSign/portal with timestamp), reviewer sign-off, bank confirmations (MT103/SWIFT), GL upload preview and posted confirmation, timesheets/effort reports, contracts, DPA with payroll providers and exception log entries. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Staff Cost Allocation — Technical User Guide"> <strong>Required inputs & minimum documentation (per employee + per run)</strong><br>Per employee: EmployeeID, PayrollRunID, Contract/ContractID, grade, salary, FTE, tax ID, bank details (stored encrypted), allocation method, allocation % per cost code, employer costs and deduction details, timesheet/evidence (if used), approver evidence (signed or portal), any secondment/seconding agreement.<br>Per run: Payroll control sheet with totals and sign-offs; apportionment schedule (CSV) with validation checksum; GL upload preview; bank batch file and bank confirmations; statutory remittance summary and payment receipts; exception log with owner and status; payroll pack index and file checksums; change log for any post-cut-off amendments. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Staff Cost Allocation — Technical User Guide"> <strong>Apportionment lifecycle — chronological steps & timeframes</strong><br>1. Publish payroll calendar (annual) with cut-offs for HR changes, timesheets and apportionment approvals; include contingency run dates and SLA for approver response.<br>2. HR master data cut-off: lock all substantive HR changes; record emergency change process (CD/CFD approval required) and a separate "emergency changes" appendix to the pack.<br>3. Pre-run: preparer applies allocation rules and generates apportionment schedule; automated pre-flight validations executed and validation report attached.<br>4. Budget-holder approval: delivered via secure portal/email with unique approver ID; approval evidence captured and attached to apportionment row.<br>5. Independent review: sample checks and sign-off recorded with reviewer notes and sampling criteria documented.<br>6. Payment preparation: payments officer compiles bank file, ensures dual sign-off and records bank batch ID; where applicable perform bank positive-pay pre-checks.<br>7. GL posting: upload apportioned journals, store upload preview and posted confirmation, attach system logs showing uploader and time.<br>8. Reconciliation: control sheet totals reconciled to GL and bank; reconcile employer liabilities and statutory remittances; log reconciling items with owners and remedial due dates.<br>9.

Why a Payroll Officer is required<br>15.0 Short answer: the payroll officer is required to run a controlled, auditable payroll process and to be the accountable owner of day-to-day payroll preparation — but not to personally perform every related task. Payroll control depends on clear role separation and shared responsibilities across HR, finance, payments and senior approvers.<br><br>15.1 Why you need a Payroll Officer:<br>- Single accountable owner for accuracy, timeliness and documentation of payroll runs.<br>- Ensures consistent application of tax/statutory rules (e.g., PPh 21), validation checks, payslip production and audit packs.<br>- Maintains the payroll control sheet, reconciliations and traceability (PayrollRun ID, file names, archives).<br>- Drives continuous improvement, training, and first-line incident response for payroll issues.<br><br>15.2 Typical ownership (RACI-style):<br>- HR — Owns master data (contracts, joiner/leaver, tax IDs, approved changes).<br>- Payroll Officer — Prepares payroll run, calculates gross-to-net (including PPh 21 calculation), produces payslips, compiles payroll control sheet and runs reconciliations.<br>- Independent Reviewer / Authoriser (Finance or designated reviewer) — Reviews & authorises control sheet (must not be the preparer).<br>- Country Finance Director (CFD) / Approver — Reviews material adjustments, signs high-value exceptions and owns month-end accounting treatment.<br>- Bank/Payments Officer — Prepares/executes bank transfer files and secures dual sign-off per DoA.<br>- Budget Holders — Approve apportionment and verify project coding.<br>- Treasury/Centre / Outsourced Provider — Handles central processing or intercompany clearing where applicable; country remains ultimately responsible.<br>- IT/Data Protection — Enforces security, access controls, backups and PII handling. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 15</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table4" data-table="YJKN_0020_04" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Table 4</strong></div>

I require the <strong>Payroll Officer / Accountant</strong> to complete the items below immediately:<br><br>1. <strong>Complete orange cells in YJKN_Data</strong> — populate all orange-highlighted fields and validate entries.<br><br>2. <strong>Tax & statutory fields (mandatory)</strong>:<br>2.1 <strong>PPh 21</strong> — enter monthly withholding per employee, include calculation link or cell notes, verify tax IDs/residency and PTKP treatment, and record <strong>PayrollRun ID</strong> on each line.<br>2.2 <strong>BPJSTK</strong> — enter employee & employer contributions, confirm rate basis and BPJSTK IDs, and show calculation cells.<br>2.3 <strong>BPJSKES</strong> — enter health contribution amounts, confirm rate basis and BPJSKES IDs, and show calculation cells.<br><br>3. <strong>Validation & reconciliation</strong> — ensure YJKN_Data totals reconcile to the payroll control sheet and to the GL upload preview; include GL account codes and currency. Run formula checks and resolve any mismatches.<br><br>4. <strong>Pending journals</strong> — confirm, authorise and post the pending adjustment journal(s). Each posted journal must include:<br>- approval evidence (who approved and when),<br>- calculation backup,<br>- <strong>PayrollRun ID</strong>, and<br>- a clear narration referencing the payroll period and bank batch where applicable.<br><br>5. <strong>Bank evidence & GL preview</strong> — attach GL upload preview and bank advices / SWIFT confirmations required for reconciliation. Reconcile posted journals to bank advices and note any timing differences.<br><br>6. <strong>Control pack & status update</strong> — update payroll control sheet totals, compile the reconciled control pack, set the YJKN_Data status column to <strong>“Completed”</strong>, and save the control pack with the standard filename convention.<br><br>7. <strong>Reply & attachments</strong> — confirm completion by replying to this thread and attach:<br>- the updated <strong>YJKN_Data</strong> file (highlight changes),<br>- reconciled control pack (PDF),<br>- GL upload preview, and<br>- bank advices / SWIFT confirmations and journal supporting docs.<br><br>Time is critical — please confirm in-reply the expected time of upload and who will perform each item (name & role). </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 1</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
