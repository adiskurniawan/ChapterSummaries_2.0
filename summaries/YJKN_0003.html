Applies to all vendor liabilities, cross-currency payments, returned/failed payments, disputes, credit-note reconciliations, and write-offs. <strong>Objective metrics:</strong> reduce <code>Aged&gt;90</code> by X%/quarter, median Days-to-Resolution ≤ 30, 100% dispute-packet completeness for Tier-2+ items. <br> <strong>Executive summary:</strong> This document delivers an end-to-end operational framework for detecting, triaging, investigating, escalating, resolving, and evidencing long-outstanding accounts payable. It prescribes data artefacts, naming conventions, time-boxed actions, decision gates, approval authorities, automation opportunities, and audit-grade storage and retention specifications. The playbook is intended for immediate deployment as a coordinated cross-functional program and as the baseline for continuous improvement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="AP Remediation Playbook — Support Pack (Advanced)"> <strong>Canonical deliverables & filenames (strict):</strong> <br> • <code>ap_aging_vendor_invoice.csv</code> — schema (UTF-8, RFC4180, comma delimited): <code>canonicalVersion</code> (v###), <code>vendorId</code> (UUID), <code>vendorName</code> (string), <code>invoiceNumber</code> (string), <code>invoiceDate</code> (YYYY-MM-DD), <code>dueDate</code> (YYYY-MM-DD), <code>originalAmount</code> (decimal(18,2)), <code>currency</code> (ISO4217), <code>balance</code> (decimal), <code>daysPastDue</code> (int), <code>departmentCode</code> (string), <code>PO_Number</code> (string), <code>holdReason</code> (enum), <code>ownerDept</code> (code), <code>evidenceRef</code> (path/manifestHash), <code>lastContactTsUTC</code> (ISO8601).
