        </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Architecture & File Organization</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The code is a single large IIFE that mixes unrelated responsibilities: helpers, DOM plumbing, UI widgets, state snapshots, and bootstrapping live together. This monolith increases cognitive load and makes it hard to reason about dependencies or to apply disciplined changes. There is no explicit public API or module boundary. Side effects run implicitly on DOMContentLoaded and there is no clear bootstrap sequence. The absence of modularity prevents incremental replacement and makes static analysis and bundling less effective.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Decompose by responsibility into small modules with single responsibilities: dom-utils, table-manager, search-engine, clipboard-service, toast-service, ui-controls, bootstrap. Each module exposes a minimal public API. Side effects are confined to a bootstrap module that wires modules together explicitly. Use dependency injection for testability and to control lifecycle. Prefer ES modules or a bundler and maintain a clear entry point that documents initialization sequence.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>State Management & Encapsulation</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>State is kept in loose global arrays keyed by DOM order. originalTableRows and sortStates are indexed by table position, which breaks when tables are dynamically added, removed, or reordered. There is no lifecycle for caches and no clear invalidation strategy. Mutations and rendering are interleaved so it's hard to reason about when data is authoritative.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Encapsulate state per table instance using a TableManager factory or class. Use unique identifiers for tables rather than array indices. Provide explicit lifecycle methods: init, refresh, snapshot, dispose. Keep immutable snapshots or versioned states and provide explicit invalidation hooks. Store derived caches with explicit invalidation logic. This yields deterministic behavior under DOM mutation.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Event Handling & Delegation</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Multiple document-level delegated handlers are registered separately and use similar selector logic repeated across handlers. Keyboard handling and click handling are scattered. Many handlers wrap logic in try/catch, which hides ordering and priority assumptions. The design can lead to event conflicts and makes tracing event flow difficult.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Centralize event delegation into a small router or helper `on(event, selector, handler)` that supports precedence and cancellation. Map semantic actions to handlers instead of raw selectors. Isolate keyboard handling in an input controller that translates keys to semantic commands. Use passive listeners where appropriate and avoid repeated try/catch blocks; handle expected errors explicitly.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>DOM Interaction & Performance</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The code performs many synchronous DOM reads and writes inside loops, clones nodes, and often clears innerHTML. searchTable normalizes and scans cells repeatedly. These patterns cause layout thrash and jank on large tables. There is no requestAnimationFrame scheduling or batching of reads vs writes.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Separate reads from writes and batch DOM updates. Cache normalized cell text at initialization. For large tables, use virtualization or incremental rendering to keep active DOM nodes bounded. Use requestAnimationFrame for visible updates and microtask queuing for logical updates. Prefer classList/textContent changes over innerHTML to minimize reflows.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Search & Highlighting Strategy</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>searchTable normalizes cell content on each input and iterates all rows and cells twice per event, which is O(rows × cols) and expensive. Highlighting is applied per cell by toggling classes and styles. There is no index or cache and no strategy for large datasets, nor is there worker offload.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Build a searchable index or cache normalized text per cell on initialization and update it incrementally on mutation. Debounce input handling and consider tokenized search or prefix matching to reduce scanned set. For very large datasets, offload normalization/search to a web worker. Update highlighting only on cells that change state. Provide searchable metadata per column to scope searches.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Sorting Implementation</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Sorting is done by parsing text from cells, using parseFloat after stripping commas, or falling back to localeCompare. Rows are reattached by cloning or reappending nodes. Numeric and date detection is fragile and regional formats are not handled. Cloning risks losing runtime state and attached listeners. Multi-column sorts are unsupported.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Separate data from DOM: build a plain data array representing rows and columns, sort that array with robust comparators, then re-render or patch DOM in one write pass. Use Intl APIs for locale-aware parsing and formatting. Provide column-type metadata and comparator hooks. Preserve event bindings by delegating rather than cloning DOM nodes that carry ephemeral listeners. Support stable sorting and multi-key sorts.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Clipboard & Export</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>copyToClipboard uses navigator.clipboard when available and falls back to execCommand with a hidden textarea. Markdown/TSV export is built by reading DOM cells at copy time. Export operations are synchronous and can be slow for large tables. There is no structured serializer layer and no streaming support.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Implement an export service that operates on a structured data model rather than on DOM. Provide serializers for CSV, TSV, Markdown, and JSON. Use async/await for clipboard operations and centralize fallback logic. For large exports, provide chunked generation or server-assisted exports. Add progress feedback and error handling, and instrument export success/failure.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Toasts & UI Feedback</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>showToast creates and styles DOM elements in JS using inline styles computed from CSS variables and manages lifecycle with timers. There is no ARIA live region support and no centralized queueing or flood control. Fallback uses `alert`, which is inconsistent. Styling in JS couples presentation and behavior.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Implement a toast service component that appends simple semantic nodes and relies on CSS classes and transitions for presentation. Use an ARIA live region for screen readers. Provide configuration for duration, priorities, stacking, and queueing. Expose programmatic APIs to pin or dismiss toasts. Keep styling in CSS and behavior in JS with clear lifecycle management.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Accessibility & ARIA</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The code sets aria-sort attributes on headers and tries to focus buttons after sorting, but keyboard semantics, roles, and announcements are incomplete. There is no comprehensive approach to live region updates or focus management for dynamic content. Contrast derived from CSS variables is used without explicit accessibility checks.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Adopt a systematic accessibility checklist. Ensure interactive headers are keyboard operable and have explicit aria-labels, and that table roles are declared where necessary. Add live region announcements for major state changes. Test with screen readers. Integrate automated accessibility checks (axe) in CI. Ensure contrast ratios and focus-visible indicators meet WCAG 2.1 AA.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Error Handling & Observability</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The code uses many empty catch blocks that swallow errors silently. This hides issues from developers and prevents actionable observability. Failures are sometimes surfaced via `alert` but there is no consistent logging, context, or telemetry.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Fail fast where appropriate and log structured errors with context such as table id and user action. Avoid blanket silent catches. Integrate lightweight telemetry for key failures and add breadcrumbs to error reports. Provide a configurable error handler that can escalate to an error reporting service in production and log more verbosely in development.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Testing & Quality Assurance</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The script claims "checked 100×" but has no automated tests included. Utilities like debounce, comparators, and normalization lack unit tests. Integration behavior for edge cases (virtualized placeholders, dynamic DOM) is untested. There is no linting, type checking, or CI enforcement visible.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Drive development with tests. Unit test utilities, integration test table behaviors, and add end-to-end tests for user flows using Playwright or Cypress. Enforce linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier). Consider TypeScript for critical interfaces or at least JSDoc types. Run tests and linters in CI and gate merges on passing checks.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Security & Input Sanitization</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The script inserts inline SVG via innerHTML and reads DOM content to produce markup. If table content originates from untrusted sources there is risk of XSS. Prompt fallback for clipboard also exposes UI surfaces that might be abused. There is no CSP guidance or sanitization strategy.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Avoid innerHTML for untrusted content. Use textContent for data cells and only use safe templates for known markup. Apply sanitization libraries when rendering HTML from external sources. Recommend and document a CSP for the page. Treat clipboard and prompt content as untrusted and sanitize on paste. Include security checks in code reviews.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Internationalization & Localization</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Number detection relies on parseFloat after removing commas which fails for locales using different group separators. Date parsing and formatting are not locale-aware. UI strings are hard-coded and not prepared for translation. Right-to-left layouts are not considered.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Use Intl APIs for parsing and formatting numbers and dates. Extract UI strings to resource bundles and support locale loading. Normalize search and lowercasing using locale-aware methods. Support RTL via CSS and detect locale to adjust behaviors. Provide pluralization and translation keys for messages.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Performance Budgets & Bundle Strategy</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The file is monolithic and runs most logic on DOMContentLoaded even if some features are rarely used. Inline styles and inlined icons increase runtime cost. There is no plan for code splitting or lazy-loading noncritical features such as clipboard or analytics.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Define performance budgets and split code into essential and nonessential bundles. Defer noncritical features and lazy-load heavy modules. Use dynamic imports for rarely used capabilities. Measure TTI and other web vitals and optimize for those targets. Prefer shipping a small core that enables interactivity quickly and load enhancements afterward.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Styling & Theming</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Styling is often applied inline from JavaScript, particularly for toasts and the back-to-top button. Theme switching manipulates attributes but many visual details are inlined. This couples presentation to JS and complicates theming.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Keep presentation in CSS using custom properties and utility classes. JS should only toggle classes or data attributes. Centralize theme variables in a single stylesheet and use CSS transitions for animations. Make theme switching declarative by changing a root data attribute and letting CSS handle visuals.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Progressive Enhancement & Resilience</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The behavior assumes JS will run and aggressively enhances the page. While guards exist, the site lacks a clear no-JS fallback strategy for exports, navigation, and basic table reading. That reduces resilience and degrades experience for users with JS disabled.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Design with progressive enhancement. Ensure table content and basic navigation and copyability work without JS. Provide server-side or static links for exports as fallback. Apply enhancements when JS is available. This improves accessibility, SEO, and robustness.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Developer Experience & Onboarding</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The single-file approach lacks modular documentation, README, or type hints. New contributors must read the entire file to understand interactions. There is little in the way of contribution guidance, code ownership, or PR standards.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Improve DX with a README, module-level docs, and CONTRIBUTING.md. Use small focused modules with clear exported types. Provide examples and a storybook for interactive components. Enforce commit conventions and provide PR templates. Add a changelog and semantic versioning.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Observability & Operational Readiness</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>There are no metrics, health checks, or operational knobs. Failures are visible only as console logs or broken UI. There is no telemetry for usage or regression detection, and no knobs to disable features in production quickly.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Instrument key events and measure latencies: search time, sort time, export success. Add lightweight health probes for core capabilities. Expose feature flags to toggle risky features. Send minimal telemetry to dashboards for monitoring and create alerting thresholds for regressions.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Refactor Strategy & Risk Mitigation</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Changes appear made in place without a migration plan. There is no strangler pattern or compatibility shim strategy, and no tests to guard behavior. This raises risk for large refactors.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Adopt an incremental refactor strategy. Introduce new modules behind feature flags. Use the strangler pattern to replace pieces one at a time and keep compatibility shims until stable. Add tests around the interface contract and roll out gradually with metrics.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Modularity & Public APIs</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The script exposes a few globals on window but does not define a coherent public API. Consumers of the page must rely on global names and DOM side effects. That hinders reuse and composition.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Define minimal, documented public APIs for table interactions. Export module functions and avoid polluting the global scope. Provide a small namespace or attach an explicit object to window only when necessary with clear methods and versioning. Version the API to avoid breaking changes.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Caching & Memoization</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>No memoization is applied for repeated expensive computations. Normalization and comparator work is repeated per call. Larger tables pay the cost repeatedly for the same static content.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Cache normalized values and derived comparators. Use memoization for idempotent utilities and throttle expensive operations. Provide cache invalidation hooks for dynamic updates. Consider weak maps for per-node caches to avoid memory leaks.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Virtualization & Large Data Handling</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>The code assumes full DOM representation of a table. For large datasets this is expensive and can cause memory and performance problems. There are checks for placeholder classes but no full virtualization strategy.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Implement virtualization or windowing to keep DOM node count bounded for large datasets. Provide an abstraction layer so virtualization can be enabled or disabled per table. Keep row templates lightweight and reuse nodes. Consider progressive hydration for very large initial payloads.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Concurrency & Async Resilience</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>Asynchronous operations like clipboard writes and debounce timers are used but there is no cancellation strategy or queueing for overlapping operations. Race conditions are possible if multiple user actions occur rapidly.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Use cancellable promises or abort controllers for async tasks that can be superseded. Queue or debounce user actions where appropriate and ensure operations are idempotent. Provide backpressure mechanisms and document expected ordering semantics.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Feature Flags & Rollouts</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>There is no feature gating or ability to toggle behavior at runtime. All users get the same code path. That makes it harder to perform canary releases or disable problematic features quickly.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Integrate a lightweight feature flag system or use server-side toggles to gate experimental behavior. Support gradual rollout and quick rollback. Use flags for new UI components, alternative search algorithms, or telemetry sampling.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Metrics & KPIs</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>No metrics are collected to evaluate performance or user behavior. There is no measurement of search latency, sort time, export frequency, or feature usage.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Define and collect a minimal set of KPIs: search latency distribution, sort time percentiles, export attempts and failure rate, toast frequency, and UI error counts. Use these to prioritize optimizations and detect regressions.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>CI/CD & Release Process</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>There is no visible CI pipeline or release process. Changes may be merged without automated validation. That increases risk of regressions.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Adopt CI with lint, tests, and basic accessibility and performance checks. Automate builds, run end-to-end tests in staging, and gate deploys on passing checks. Use semantic versioning and release notes for each deployment.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Area"><p>Documentation & Runbooks</p></td><td data-label="Your JavaScript (conceptual critique)"><p>In-code comments exist but there is no consolidated documentation or runbooks for production incidents. On-call engineers lack guidance on common failures.</p></td><td data-label="World-class Programmer’s JavaScript (conceptual refinement)"><p>Create concise documentation: README, architecture diagram, API docs, and runbooks for common failures. Provide steps to reproduce issues and mitigation instructions. Keep runbooks close to code and version them.</p></td></tr>
