Kasparov tried to intimidate Deep Blue by tapping his watch to signal confidence and boredom, illustrating psychological gamesmanship. Deep Blue’s designers embedded subtle randomness in moves, making it appear human-like and unpredictable. Kasparov overestimated his ability to manipulate a machine psychologically, resulting in a 3½–2½ defeat. This demonstrated that algorithms could exploit human behavioral biases and that human misjudgment, not just computational strength, can determine outcomes.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Algorithm Definition and Everyday Relevance<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Algorithms are formal step-by-step procedures for solving problems or achieving goals. They are used in daily life: recipes, assembly instructions like IKEA manuals, YouTube tutorial sequences, and financial calculations. In computing, algorithms translate abstract problem-solving logic into precise operations a machine can execute. Beyond computing, algorithms structure decisions in medicine (diagnosis), logistics (delivery routing), and law (risk assessment), showing their pervasive influence.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Four Main Algorithm Tasks<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><ol><li><b>Prioritization:<b> Algorithms rank items or make decisions based on importance. Examples include Google Search ranking, Netflix recommendation systems, TomTom GPS routing, and Deep Blue selecting chess moves. <p></p>2. <b>Classification:<b> Sorting data into categories. Used in social media moderation (Facebook detecting harmful posts), YouTube content classification, OCR (handwriting recognition), and spam filtering. <p></p>3. <b>Association:<b> Identifying relationships between items. Examples include Amazon’s product recommendations, OKCupid’s dating suggestions, and LinkedIn’s professional networking recommendations. <p></p>4. <b>Filtering:<b> Selecting relevant information from large datasets. Examples include Siri/Alexa interpreting spoken commands, social media feeds personalized via filtering, and UberPool matching riders based on routes and timing. UberPool is an example of a system that simultaneously uses prioritization, association, and filtering for operational efficiency.</li></ol></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Types of Algorithms<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p><b>Rule-Based Algorithms:<b> Operate on explicit instructions, easy to understand, predictable, but limited by human knowledge and rules. Examples: tax calculators, basic route planners, chess engines using fixed heuristics. <br> <b>Machine Learning Algorithms:<b> Learn patterns from data, adjust outputs dynamically, capable of handling complex problems. Examples: Google Translate, autonomous vehicle navigation, image recognition systems. Caveat: ML models are opaque, often making decisions that humans cannot easily interpret (“black box problem”). Illustrative issue: altering one pixel in an image can cause misclassification in ML models.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Over-trusting Algorithms (Blind Faith)<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Humans often overestimate algorithmic reliability. Example: Robert Jones followed GPS directions blindly and nearly drove off a cliff. Search engine bias experiments (Kadoodle) showed that algorithmic ranking can subtly influence public opinion and voting behavior. People assume algorithms are objective and superior to human judgment, ignoring that algorithms encode human biases and can produce unexpected errors. In professional settings, over-trust can lead to poor medical decisions, financial misjudgments, or operational failures.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Poor Algorithmic Design and Consequences<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Algorithms are only as good as their design, data, and monitoring. Example: Idaho Medicaid used a faulty Excel spreadsheet to allocate benefits. The buggy algorithm resulted in arbitrary benefit denials and wrongful financial decisions. Humans trusted the system blindly, demonstrating a lack of oversight. Legal consequences followed (ACLU lawsuit), revealing how automated decision-making without human checks can violate fairness and constitutional rights. This highlights the importance of auditing algorithms, validating data, and embedding human oversight mechanisms.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>When Humans Must Overrule Algorithms<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Humans should act as final arbiters in critical decisions. <br> <b>Positive Example:<b> Stanislav Petrov ignored a false Soviet nuclear alert in 1983, preventing a possible nuclear escalation. <br> <b>Negative Example:<b> Alton Towers rollercoaster disaster occurred when engineers manually overrode a safety algorithm, causing injuries. These cases underscore that human intervention must be judicious, informed, and cautious: over-reliance or reckless overrides can both be catastrophic.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Algorithm vs Human Reliability<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Research demonstrates that algorithms often outperform humans in prediction tasks. Paul Meehl <br>(1954) showed simple statistical algorithms predict outcomes (medical, psychological, and financial) more accurately than experts relying on intuition. Yet humans exhibit <b>algorithm aversion<b>, disproportionately reacting to rare algorithm errors while ignoring frequent human mistakes. Practical examples include Citymapper and Waze for navigation, where algorithmic suggestions are consistently more accurate than human route selection. The lesson: humans must calibrate trust and remain aware of cognitive biases when evaluating algorithm outputs.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Psychological Interactions and Human Bias<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Algorithms exploit cognitive biases, such as anchoring, confirmation bias, and overconfidence. For instance, chess engines exploit human predictability by choosing suboptimal but psychologically confusing moves. Social media algorithms use engagement heuristics that reinforce confirmation bias, leading to echo chambers. Algorithms can subtly manipulate choices, from online shopping to political opinions, emphasizing the ethical need for transparency, user awareness, and consent.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Balanced Approach to Algorithms<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>Optimal use requires neither blind trust nor excessive skepticism. Awareness of algorithmic limitations, human cognitive biases, and ethical considerations is critical. Critical evaluation includes checking for errors, validating datasets, understanding algorithmic objectives, and combining human judgement with automated assistance. This hybrid approach is especially important in healthcare, finance, legal decisions, autonomous vehicles, and social media content moderation.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Case Studies and Lessons<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><ol><li><b>Deep Blue vs Kasparov:<b> Machines exploiting human psychological weaknesses, not just computational power. <p></p>2. <b>Robert Jones GPS near-miss:<b> Over-trust in navigation systems. <p></p>3. <b>Idaho Medicaid algorithm:<b> Poor design, human blind trust, legal consequences. <p></p>4. <b>Stanislav Petrov nuclear alert:<b> Critical human intervention preventing disaster. <p></p>5. <b>Alton Towers rollercoaster crash:<b> Reckless override of safety algorithms causing harm. <p></p>6. <b>Machine learning misclassification (image pixel example):<b> Shows black box vulnerability and fragility of ML systems. <p></p>7. <b>Kadoodle search bias experiment:<b> Algorithmic influence on voter behavior and societal outcomes.</li></ol></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Ethical and Societal Implications<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><p>The rise of algorithms raises ethical questions: fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Automated systems affect life-and-death decisions (medical diagnosis, autonomous cars), resource distribution (social services, finance), and societal perception (news feeds, search engine results). Over-trusting or misusing algorithms can reinforce inequality and bias. Regulatory frameworks, algorithmic audits, and informed human oversight are essential to mitigate these risks.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="<b>Summary / Core Concepts<b>"><p><b>Recommendations for Human-Algorithm Interaction<b></p></td><td data-label="<b>Supporting Details / Examples<b>"><ol><li>Verify algorithm outputs with human review in critical areas. <p></p>2. Avoid blind reliance; understand algorithmic limitations. <p></p>3. Encourage transparency: explainability of decisions. <p></p>4. Use algorithms for augmentation, not replacement of human judgement. <p></p>5. Embed auditing, feedback loops, and fail-safe mechanisms. <p></p>6. Educate users and professionals about algorithmic biases and reliability issues. <p></p>7. In high-stakes scenarios (nuclear alerts, medical interventions), prioritize layered human-algorithm checks.</li></ol></td></tr>

Tesla’s autopilot exemplifies Level 2: it can steer, brake, and accelerate on motorways, but still expects the human to monitor the road. Audi’s traffic-jam pilot approaches Level 3 by taking over in slow-moving traffic.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><p><b>Partial automation introduces human skill degradation.<b> Overreliance on autopilot can reduce drivers’ ability to respond in emergencies.</p></td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Examples"><p>Air France flight 447 illustrates this: pilot Pierre-Cédric Bonin, inexperienced with manual flying, failed to respond correctly when the autopilot disengaged due to iced air-speed sensors. The plane entered a steep climb, lost lift, and crashed. This aligns with Lisanne Bainbridge’s 1983 warning: automation that improves human performance can ironically erode it.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><p><b>Hands-off systems create delayed response hazards.<b> When drivers are inattentive, regaining control during emergencies takes significant time.</p></td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Examples"><p>Simulations show it may take up to 40 seconds for a driver to regain control after an alarm. Tesla driver Joshua Brown’s fatal 2016 crash highlights real-world consequences: he had been in Autopilot mode for 37½ minutes and was not paying attention when a truck crossed his lane.

<tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><p><b>Human–machine complementary systems may be more effective.<b> Instead of replacing drivers entirely, automation can augment human skills.</p></td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Examples"><p>Toyota’s “guardian” mode monitors the road while a human drives, acting as a safety net. Audi and Volvo also emphasize systems that intervene selectively, supporting drivers rather than substituting for them entirely. This mirrors medical AI, which complements human pattern recognition rather than fully replacing it.</p></td></tr>
