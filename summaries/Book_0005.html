Deep Blue’s designers embedded subtle randomness in moves, making it appear human-like and unpredictable. Kasparov overestimated his ability to manipulate a machine psychologically, resulting in a 3½–2½ defeat. This demonstrated that algorithms could exploit human behavioral biases and that human misjudgment, not just computational strength, can determine outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"> <strong>Algorithm Definition and Everyday Relevance</strong>     </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Examples"> Algorithms are formal step-by-step procedures for solving problems or achieving goals.

Automated systems affect life-and-death decisions (medical diagnosis, autonomous cars), resource distribution (social services, finance), and societal perception (news feeds, search engine results). Over-trusting or misusing algorithms can reinforce inequality and bias. Regulatory frameworks, algorithmic audits, and informed human oversight are essential to mitigate these risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"> <strong>Recommendations for Human-Algorithm Interaction</strong> </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Examples"> 1.
