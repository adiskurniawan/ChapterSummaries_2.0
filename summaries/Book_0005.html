Kasparov tried to intimidate Deep Blue by tapping his watch to signal confidence and boredom, illustrating psychological gamesmanship. Deep Blue’s designers embedded subtle randomness in moves, making it appear human-like and unpredictable. Kasparov overestimated his ability to manipulate a machine psychologically, resulting in a 3½–2½ defeat. This demonstrated that algorithms could exploit human behavioral biases and that human misjudgment, not just computational strength, can determine outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr>

They are used in daily life: recipes, assembly instructions like IKEA manuals, YouTube tutorial sequences, and financial calculations. In computing, algorithms translate abstract problem-solving logic into precise operations a machine can execute. Beyond computing, algorithms structure decisions in medicine (diagnosis), logistics (delivery routing), and law (risk assessment), showing their pervasive influence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>

Examples include Google Search ranking, Netflix recommendation systems, TomTom GPS routing, and Deep Blue selecting chess moves. <br> 2. **Classification:** Sorting data into categories. Used in social media moderation (Facebook detecting harmful posts), YouTube content classification, OCR (handwriting recognition), and spam filtering. <br> 3. **Association:** Identifying relationships between items. Examples include Amazon’s product recommendations, OKCupid’s dating suggestions, and LinkedIn’s professional networking recommendations. <br> 4. **Filtering:** Selecting relevant information from large datasets. Examples include Siri/Alexa interpreting spoken commands, social media feeds personalized via filtering, and UberPool matching riders based on routes and timing. UberPool is an example of a system that simultaneously uses prioritization, association, and filtering for operational efficiency. </td></tr>

Examples: tax calculators, basic route planners, chess engines using fixed heuristics. <br> **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Learn patterns from data, adjust outputs dynamically, capable of handling complex problems. Examples: Google Translate, autonomous vehicle navigation, image recognition systems. Caveat: ML models are opaque, often making decisions that humans cannot easily interpret (“black box problem”). Illustrative issue: altering one pixel in an image can cause misclassification in ML models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>

Example: Robert Jones followed GPS directions blindly and nearly drove off a cliff. Search engine bias experiments (Kadoodle) showed that algorithmic ranking can subtly influence public opinion and voting behavior. People assume algorithms are objective and superior to human judgment, ignoring that algorithms encode human biases and can produce unexpected errors. In professional settings, over-trust can lead to poor medical decisions, financial misjudgments, or operational failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>

Example: Idaho Medicaid used a faulty Excel spreadsheet to allocate benefits. The buggy algorithm resulted in arbitrary benefit denials and wrongful financial decisions. Humans trusted the system blindly, demonstrating a lack of oversight. Legal consequences followed (ACLU lawsuit), revealing how automated decision-making without human checks can violate fairness and constitutional rights. This highlights the importance of auditing algorithms, validating data, and embedding human oversight mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>

These cases underscore that human intervention must be judicious, informed, and cautious: over-reliance or reckless overrides can both be catastrophic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="**Summary / Core Concepts**">**Algorithm vs Human Reliability**                  </td><td data-label="**Supporting Details / Examples**">Research demonstrates that algorithms often outperform humans in prediction tasks. Paul Meehl (1954) showed simple statistical algorithms predict outcomes (medical, psychological, and financial) more accurately than experts relying on intuition. Yet humans exhibit **algorithm aversion**, disproportionately reacting to rare algorithm errors while ignoring frequent human mistakes. Practical examples include Citymapper and Waze for navigation, where algorithmic suggestions are consistently more accurate than human route selection. The lesson: humans must calibrate trust and remain aware of cognitive biases when evaluating algorithm outputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>

Social media algorithms use engagement heuristics that reinforce confirmation bias, leading to echo chambers. Algorithms can subtly manipulate choices, from online shopping to political opinions, emphasizing the ethical need for transparency, user awareness, and consent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>

Regulatory frameworks, algorithmic audits, and informed human oversight are essential to mitigate these risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>
