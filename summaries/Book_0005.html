Kasparov tried to intimidate Deep Blue by tapping his watch to signal confidence and boredom, illustrating psychological gamesmanship. Deep Blue’s designers embedded subtle randomness in moves, making it appear human-like and unpredictable. Kasparov overestimated his ability to manipulate a machine psychologically, resulting in a 3½–2½ defeat. This demonstrated that algorithms could exploit human behavioral biases and that human misjudgment, not just computational strength, can determine outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr>

People assume algorithms are objective and superior to human judgment, ignoring that algorithms encode human biases and can produce unexpected errors. In professional settings, over-trust can lead to poor medical decisions, financial misjudgments, or operational failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>

Automated systems affect life-and-death decisions (medical diagnosis, autonomous cars), resource distribution (social services, finance), and societal perception (news feeds, search engine results). Over-trusting or misusing algorithms can reinforce inequality and bias. Regulatory frameworks, algorithmic audits, and informed human oversight are essential to mitigate these risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>
