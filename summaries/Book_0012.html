These constraints create a strong prior for talent scouts and coaches: if you match the body type and daily volume, you’re probably the right candidate for elite success. That prior works much of the time because physiology and accumulated practice interact multiplicatively. But it creates a false negative risk: athletes outside the envelope with alternative leverage—unique flexibility, anaerobic capacity, superior technique, unusual anthropometrics—are easily overlooked. Understanding those priors is the first step in designing experiments that seek asymmetric advantages. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Berkoff’s physical disadvantages — anatomy, psychology, and misclassification:</strong><br><br>Berkoff’s size placed him far from the population mean scouts expected. Size is a visible proxy for several latent variables (stroke length, power, leverage), and human decision-makers overweight visible proxies.<br><br>Combine that with Berkoff’s low intrinsic interest in conventional practice and you get two classification errors:<br>1. False-negative recruitment.<br>2. Misaligned motivation-tailoring from coaches.<br><br>Both errors were remediable through experimental reorientation: ask what capacities his body actually offered (mobility, turning speed, breath tolerance) and design tests that reveal comparative advantage. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Why experiments beat intuition in this context</strong>:<br><br>Intuition and benchmark thinking favor incremental optimization of known variables. Experiments force hypothesis-driven departures: treat race-start mechanics, the underwater phase, and transition timing as independent variables to be varied systematically.<br><br>Berkoff’s success shows three experimental truths:<br>(a) decompose complex tasks into measurable components,<br>(b) run controlled variations to reveal nonobvious gains,<br>(c) pursue marginal gains cumulatively.<br><br>In short: experiments replace “this is how we’ve always done it” with “let’s test whether different assumptions produce faster outcomes.”                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Biomechanics and the underwater lever — why the Blastoff worked</strong>:<br><br>Two physical facts made the underwater advantage decisive:<br>1. Drag regimes change with body position — streamlined, fully submerged dolphin-kicking produces a lower drag-to-propulsion ratio than surface-based stroking for short bursts.<br>2. In a 50–100m race, the start + early phase contributes disproportionately to total time because acceleration is difficult to generate mid-race.<br><br>Berkoff’s insight was an operational hypothesis: maximize distance covered while in the lower-drag underwater regime. The resulting experimental program increased breath-hold tolerance, refined dolphin-kick mechanics, and conditioned the nervous system to resist respiratory panic during the highest oxygen-demand phase.                                                                            </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Training design: progressive overload for breath tolerance and power</strong>:<br><br>An implementable plan inspired by Berkoff’s progression:<br>1. Baseline assessment — maximum comfortable underwater distance and time, plus heart-rate recovery markers.<br>2. Progressive interval work — repeated 15–25m underwater dolphin-kick sets with graded rest.<br>3. Tolerance adaptation — combine breath-hold sets with submaximal hypoxic repeats on land and in water (done safely, with supervision).<br>4. Strength-power integration — short high-force dryland hip-extension, core-stabilization, and ankle-plantar-flexion work to transfer power to the dolphin kick.<br>5. Integration runs — convert underwater distance into optimized start + breakout timing using race-pace repeats.<br><br>Each microcycle spans 7–14 days; use 4–6 week mesocycles with explicit performance metrics. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Psychology and behavioral levers — motivating a practice-averse athlete</strong>:<br>Berkoff hated practice. Experimental coaching leveraged that by making training cognitively novel: new techniques taught at the end of long sessions, variety, and short high-salience micro-goals (increase underwater distance by 5–10% per week). Behavioral levers used: immediate feedback loops (video replay), micro-rewards for incremental gains, social proof (pair him with curious teammates), and identity priming (frame training as “research” rather than punishment). This shifts effort from pure willpower to curiosity-driven engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>OODA loop applied — practical iteration schedule</strong>:<br>Observe: baseline metrics (split times, underwater distance, stroke rate, RPE).<br>Orient: analyze constraints — physiology, flexibility, motivation, coaching bandwidth.<br>Decide: pick 1–2 variables to test (e.g., underwater distance, breakout depth).<br>Act: execute a 2–4 week focused protocol with pre-registered outcomes.

FINA’s rule limiting submerged distance after the start can be read as a safety precaution (risk to inexperienced swimmers), a normative judgment (“this isn’t backstroke”), and a gatekeeping response to rapid change. For innovators this means: design experiments that also account for regulatory externalities—evaluate safety, scalability, and fairness up front—and be ready to argue for gradual adoption or formal codification if the technique proves robust.                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Ethics, diffusion, and the responsibility of pioneers</strong>:<br>Rapid diffusion of a high-risk technique can harm novices who copy elite practice without coaching. Berkoff’s method exposed younger swimmers to breath-hold stress. Ethical experimentalism requires: safety protocols, dissemination of training progressions, and clear competency thresholds for attempting the method. Innovators and coaches bear partial responsibility to publish safety guidelines when an experimental technique spreads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="10 EXPERIMENTATION"> <strong>Case studies — Spurrier’s Judgment of Paris & Perpetual Guardian: experiments that change markets and norms</strong>:<br>Spurrier’s blind tasting and Perpetual Guardian’s four-day trial share experimental features: low-cost intervention, credible measurement, and public reporting.

He’d released a string of wildly successful albums with Art Garfunkel in the 1960s, and Simon’s solo career was booming. Several times during that period, TV personality Dick Cavett invited Simon on his talk show to discuss music and creativity. You can find those interviews online, and they all begin the same way: Simon, sitting awkwardly opposite Cavett, is unsure where to focus his eyes. He looks at the camera, at Cavett, at the studio audience, and then repeats that script.<br><br>Simon’s answers to Cavett’s first few questions are whispered, self-conscious, and brief. During one interview, Simon looks up to discover a boom mic sitting just above his head and asks, “Am I speaking too softly? Is that why the mic just went up?” There’s a gulf between Paul Simon’s towering musical prowess and his discomfort as a talk-show guest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>The moment of transformation — action as a context switch</strong>:<br><br>But then during each interview something shifts. And it shifts the same way each time. Cavett asks a well-timed question about some aspect of Simon’s music, and Simon picks up his guitar. A question about how he wrote “Mrs. Robinson,” the song tied forever to Mike Nichols’ film <em>The Graduate</em>. Or a question about how Simon wrote “Bridge over Troubled Water,” which won five Grammys and became a spiritual hymn for a generation of atheists.<br><br>As soon as Simon plays his guitar and starts <em>doing</em> rather than thinking or speaking, he becomes a different guest. He’s charming and fluid. His answers are longer and easier to follow, and he’s luminous. Many of the people watching these videos of Simon have noticed the same thing. “The second he picks up the guitar, he blooms,” says a commenter named Davi. Nearly five hundred people agree. In reply to another clip, jontgreene says, “He is so much more comfortable speaking after he sings. That’s great.” Four hundred people agree. Rhys, a third commenter, says, “The moment the guitar was in his hand, he softened. He felt in his natural habitat again. I appreciate that.” Nicole Marie replied, “Yeah, Paul seems shy until that guitar is in his hands.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Action unstickers: inspiration + doing</strong>:<br><br>What unsticks Simon is action. As soon as he holds and then plays his guitar, he relaxes. His words flow again. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of watching Simon bloom is that he’s aware of the change. He knows that action is his unsticker. Walking Cavett and his audience through a series of phrases from “Bridge over Troubled Water,” Simon explains how he connected each element to the next. The video’s viewers comment on this ethereal moment, on how lucky they are to have a genius walk them through his process. Simon admits that the song was easy to write, until it wasn’t. He plays and hums to a fifteen-second melody, then stops abruptly. “I was stuck there. That was all I had of that melody.” Cavett asks, “What made you stuck?” Simon replies, Zen-like, “Well, everywhere I went, I didn’t wanna be.” The audience laughs, and Cavett calls that “the best definition of stuck I’ve heard in my life.”<br><br>Cavett asks, “When you get a block like that, how do you break through?” Simon explains that he listened to a fast-paced gospel song over and over, which inspired him to sit down with his guitar. The rest is history. It’s not a flippant answer, but it doesn’t demystify the process much. All Simon can point to is a kernel of inspiration paired with action. The action is key. He sits with his guitar, noodles a bit, loosens up, and the creative impasse relents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Actions precede feeling and thought — psychological framing</strong>:<br><br>If getting unstuck is a combination of feelings, thoughts, and actions, the driving force among this trio is actions.

Without guitar in hand, Simon is shy and reserved; as soon as he starts to act, he produces a hymn for the ages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>From momentary unsticking to durable habits</strong>:<br><br>This isn’t just true of Paul Simon, or of musical geniuses in general. Psychologists have been interested in the relationships between feelings, thoughts, and actions for a long time, and one of their key insights is that actions are paramount. You may have heard the idea, for example, that smiling makes you feel happier and think happy thoughts. The mere act of smiling matters so much that wearing a fake smile can fool you into feeling happy. The same basic idea applies to making breakthroughs more broadly. If you’re trying to write a song on the guitar, you can get nowhere by humming melodies in your head, over and over, or you can pick up the instrument and begin strumming. Paul Simon found inspiration in a gospel tune, and he listened to that tune hundreds of times. But not until he picked up his guitar did the tune turn into more than idle inspiration. It was the marriage of inspiration and action that produced magic.<br><br>As important as actions are for unsticking in the moment, they’re critical for building habits that make getting stuck less likely in the long run. Thinking or feeling the same thing every day is useful, but <em>doing</em> the same thing every day is much more likely to endure. In one study, an economist tracked the handwashing behavior of thirteen thousand health-care workers during more than 2 million shifts across five years. Hospitals struggle with this sort of compliance, many considering it a major sticking point. They introduce mantra-driven policies with names like “Gel-in, gel-out,” which require workers to sanitize their hands every time they enter and exit a patient’s room, but the results are modest. In this study, for example, compliance rates hovered around 50 or 60 percent for most workers. Some complied more than others, but across more than 100 million opportunities to sanitize, the health-care workers failed to wash their hands <em>52 million</em> times. Each failure to sanitize is a potential disaster for patients with weakened immune systems, particularly as hospitals grapple with superbugs that respond poorly to antibiotics. Four percent of patients suffer a health-care-associated infection, and one hundred thousand die in US hospitals each year alone. Every 1 percent rise in hand sanitizing reduces these infections by 2 percent, so the stakes are significant.                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Behavioral prediction: past acts forecast future acts</strong>:<br><br>The best way to predict whether health-care workers will wash their hands in the future is to consider how they’ve acted in the past. Compliance rates rise the more opportunities workers have to wash their hands in a particular room—to develop action habits that become automatic. By the tenth visit to a particular room, compliance rates rise 1.5 percent over their initial levels. By thirty visits, they rise by 2 percent, and by fifty visits by almost 3 percent. The more workers sanitize their hands, the less susceptible they become to fatigue. Those who develop action-based habits continue to sanitize their hands even as their shifts stretch beyond eight, nine, or ten hours—but those who haven’t developed the same habit tend to sanitize much less often as the day wears on. Habitual sanitizers also continue sanitizing even after they’ve taken a weeklong break from work, whereas those who haven’t formed those habits become noncompliant relatively quickly. Education and catchy policy names aren’t enough to encourage compliance; what matters most is the act of washing over and over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Identity change through repeated action</strong>:<br><br>Action also matters because it changes how we see ourselves, which in turns unsticks us. If you run occasionally, you might tell someone, “I run,” but if you run habitually, say four times a week, you might instead say, “I’m a runner.” The difference is subtle but critical. “I run” focuses on the action that you do from time to time; but “I’m a runner” focuses on your essence. The label attaches itself to you, and you become a runner whether or not you’re running at any particular moment. Running is central to your identity, so running regularly changes how you think and feel about yourself. Seeing yourself as a runner, rather than as someone who runs sometimes, is a great force for unsticking. A person who’s struggling to exercise regularly after an extended illness has far less to overcome if she sees herself as a runner who has not been running recently, rather than as someone who hasn’t run in a long time. A break in running doesn’t compromise her status as a runner.<br><br>Psychologists have shown that doing an action repeatedly—moving from verb (run) to noun (runner)—prevents friction and encourages action across many contexts. People who say “I’m a voter” are more likely to vote than those who say “I vote.” People who say “I’m a water saver” are more likely to conserve water than those who say “I save water.” Kids aged three to six years are more likely to help an adult when they think of themselves as “being a helper” rather than merely “helping.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Action’s flexibility — when the right act is unclear</strong>:<br><br>“Action” takes on different meanings in different contexts.

But when you’re saddled with uncertainty, often the right next step is any step at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Sacred pauses vs. prompt action</strong>:<br><br>The value of action doesn’t speak against taking one of Tara Brach’s “sacred pauses.” If you’re anxious and uncertain how to proceed, pausing is valuable.

Writing is hard. Some people write more fluidly than others, but almost everyone who writes gets stuck from time to time. To writers, the relevant kernel of action is a single word or a single sentence or, say, sixty seconds tapping at the keyboard. Sometimes, when I’m really stuck, I make one of these kernels my target. I might set the timer on my watch for, say, sixty seconds, and I’ll write till the timer rings. I don’t expect to write much, but writing briefly is an unsticking agent. I go from <em>not writing</em> to <em>writing.</em> If that sixty-second period passes easily—as often happens—I ignore the timer and continue writing. If I need more structure, I might reset the timer and write for two minutes, or ten minutes, and repeat the process after that period has passed. What’s important isn’t the quantity of action, but that action takes place at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Rigidity as liberation — microscheduling explained</strong>:<br><br>Using a timer to govern behavior seems rigid, which might seem like exactly the wrong approach when you’re stuck. What could be more constraining than rigidity? But structure turns out to be freeing when you’re stuck. The more structure you have, the fewer decisions you need to make, and so the more cognitive capacity you have for the task at hand. If you know you’re, say, writing for sixty seconds, all that remains is to allow your brain to empty its ideas onto the page. You’ve allowed your brain to do that because it isn’t preoccupied with other questions like “What else could I be doing with this sixty-second period?” or “How long should I spend on this task before I give up completely?” When you’re stuck, you can connect kernels of activity together. Write for several periods of a few minutes each, and then read for several periods of a few minutes each. Connecting these kernels is known as microscheduling.<br><br>Microscheduling requires breaking a longer time into briefer periods—chunks of ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes each, for example. Before that longer period begins, you decide how you’ll use each chunk. You might plan to spend fifteen minutes writing; then fifteen minutes reading; then fifteen minutes taking a break; then fifteen minutes taking a walk; and so on. You can connect two chunks together if one particular task requires more time. What matters when you microschedule is that you give yourself up to the schedule. You allow the schedule to dictate what you’ll do, when, and for how long so you can concentrate on the act itself. So much of what paralyzes us when we’re stuck isn’t the act we’re supposed to be doing, but rather the questions that hover above the act like a curious vulture. “Why is this so hard?” “Why am I not making more progress?” “Should I be doing something else instead?” “How much longer do I need to spend on this?” Most of those questions dissolve instantly when you microschedule because you’re committed to spending a certain amount of time on the act no matter how difficult it is. By forcing yourself to spend that time on the task—by removing the option to disengage—you liberate yourself to focus on the task completely. By choosing a short burst of action, rather than a block of many hours, you’re unlikely to feel overwhelmed. You silence the questioning voices in your head by defining your goal as simply and narrowly as possible—as the ability to simply spend a predetermined period on a certain action, regardless of your output. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Microscheduling’s limits and uses</strong>:<br><br>Microscheduling isn’t the way to live your life in general.

But when you’re absolutely mired, with no apparent way through, rigidity is freeing. This is the same mental unloading that drove Steve Jobs to wear his black turtlenecks day after day, to adopt a “uniform” in an industry famous for lionizing creativity and difference, while working at a company that implored its consumers to “think different.” Jobs himself was able to “think different,” he claimed, because he was assiduous about delegating or shaving off any mental intrusion that might soak up the cognitive resources he needed to devote to creative unsticking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Movement and walking — evidence for physical unsticking</strong>:<br><br>Once you’ve microscheduled bite-size actions, the next question to ask is whether some actions more reliably unstick you than others. At least one class of candidate actions seems to unstick quite reliably. Several years ago two architects were poring over a data set that captured the locations of thousands of US firms. The data set included dozens of pieces of information about each location—or census tract, as the neighborhoods were known—and the level of innovation associated with the firms in each census tract. One result stood out to the researchers: firms that were located in highly walkable census tracts filed for many more patents—and so were more innovative—than those in census tracts that require cars or public transportation. This result wasn’t definitive, but it suggested that walking, or moving more generally, might promote creative unsticking.<br><br>Other studies found similar results. One geographer found that early-stage start-ups tend to be in highly walkable census tracts, whereas more established firms tend to cluster in less walkable areas. “The mean walk score of science/tech start-ups was significantly higher than for any other group of firms,” he noted, “and twenty points higher than for established tech firms.” Early-stage start-ups, he argued, rely on creative unsticking far more than do established firms, which have usually moved beyond the stubborn “early ideas” phase of business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Experimental evidence — treadmill study and memory</strong>:<br><br>These studies weren’t definitive because dozens of factors might have explained the relationship between walkability and innovation. For example, innovative firms might prefer to be near one another so they can share ideas, which suggests that walking, per se, might not be what drives creativity. To test the idea more carefully, other researchers asked a small group of students to spend forty minutes reading a book while either sitting still or walking on a treadmill. The researchers administered a memory test later while the participants were hooked up to sensors that measured their brain activity as they completed the task. Those who’d walked on the treadmill for forty minutes recalled 35 percent more information, were more focused on the task, and showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with memory and attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Movement’s mechanisms and cognitive effects</strong>:<br><br>Dozens of studies have now shown that moving your body is a reliable path to mental unsticking.

Studies have shown, for example, that free-flowing dance, rhythmic walking, and even tracing smooth rather than jagged, disjointed shapes inspire creativity and insight. Other studies have shown that movement doesn’t benefit every kind of thinking. Rather, it helps with stubborn problems that require innovation, novelty, and creativity, but less so with problems that simply require focused attention. You may not solve dozens of simple math puzzles more accurately, but you’re more likely to generate creative and unusual uses for a brick or a paper clip or a bucket of paint. These creativity tasks measure so-called divergent thinking, which requires you to think broadly, rather than narrowly and precisely, about a subject. Divergent thinking is critical for unsticking, because thinking convergently—focusing more and more narrowly on the task at hand—is probably what got you stuck in the first place. Divergence solves the problem by taking you beyond your instincts and intuitions to ideas and approaches that are relatively well hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Lowering standards — Jeff Tweedy’s practice of disinhibition</strong>:<br><br>Strategically lowering your standards is another excellent way to move forward when you’re stuck. That’s the position of Jeff Tweedy, the singer and guitarist in the bands Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, who has also written one of the best how-to guides for frustrated creatives. Tweedy writes about his ongoing struggle with addiction and mental health issues, so it’s natural to assume his music is the product of suffering. This is one popular model of creativity: that sublime art, music, and writing are almost always the silver lining encompassing a cloud of suffering. Not so, says Tweedy. In an interview with Ezra Klein of the <em>New York Times</em>, Tweedy dispelled the idea that suffering fuels his creativity. Instead, he suggested that art was a medication for suffering. People misunderstand the relationship between art and suffering: it’s not that suffering produces great art, but that people who suffer tend to medicate themselves by turning to creative pursuits. “I think it’s a horrible cop-out,” Tweedy says, “and it’s a pervasive myth…. If that was all it took, there’d be so much more great art.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Emptying, disinhibition, and daily practice</strong>:<br><br>Suffering isn’t Tweedy’s key to creativity. Instead, he overcomes creative roadblocks by “disappearing”—by ignoring his presence in creativity by jettisoning all self-consciousness, and allowing whatever occupies his mind to pour forth. That means lowering the filters that might normally critique new ideas as “not quite good enough.” Tweedy told Klein that he’s least likely to succeed when he’s self-critical: “I think if I’m putting really high demands on what I want to come out of myself, or when I’m just coming at it wanting to get something out of it, thinking I’m going to get a song out of this—I feel like I’m aiming at the wrong thing.”<br><br>Tweedy’s approach is to act consistently but without self-criticism or self-reflection. In his case that means writing prose, or composing music, for ten or fifteen minutes a day either before he leaves his bed in the morning or before he fires up his smartphone to read the news and check his emails:<br><br>> Like all types of writers—poets, authors, songwriters—I do rely upon a certain amount of freewriting, and emptying yourself with regularity, as a daily practice. So I would start there for anybody wanting to do this. Just exercise the muscle that pushes the ego out of the way. And that, to me, is just getting better and better at writing without judgment, without direction, without trying to steer your mind to the specific things that make you feel good about yourself, or make you think you’re smart, or make you think you’re writing well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Producing bad work as a catalytic strategy</strong>:<br><br>Tweedy takes this idea further than simply being nonjudgmental, though. He recommends not only giving yourself a pass when you’re stuck, but actively “emptying” your mind of baggage every day. Klein struggles at being bad at things, he tells Tweedy—to be a bad drawer or poet. Tweedy takes a different tack, overtly trying to produce bad work. As he explains, “To avoid writer’s block, I write songs I don’t like. I get an idea for a song, and I just go ahead and do it, even though I don’t think I’m going to like it. And that frees me up to go to the next song.”<br><br>This “emptying” is a kind of unsticking magic because it achieves two things that are difficult when you’re stuck: it frees you to act with little emotional or mental baggage, and it puts no demands on the output that flows from your actions. Obviously writing the worst poem or song or generally performing poorly isn’t the desired end. But it moves you from inert to active. Once you’re moving—and once you’ve emptied your mind of its worst ideas—you’re primed to start making real progress. There’s support for this idea, too. Entertaining bad ideas is likely to produce good ideas in time by showing you what doesn’t work. In some experiments, for example, people who hold strong beliefs about a topic are asked to think about the strongest arguments against, or the weakest arguments in favor of, those beliefs as a means to shoring up their intellectual positions. You improve by learning the difference between what works and what doesn’t, and you can fast-track that learning by forcing yourself to produce what doesn’t work before you strive to succeed. This is inoculation by opposition: the idea that you can protect yourself from failure and “doing a bad job” by exhausting yourself of bad ideas before you make a concerted effort to succeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Quantity, filters, and the pathway to quality</strong>:<br><br>Another reason to privilege the number of actions you take, rather than their quality, is that quality follows from quantity. People who generate more creative ideas tend to have better ideas, all else equal. The same is true of actions. The more you act, the more likely one of those actions is to move you forward, and the higher the average quality of those actions is likely to be. Quantity and quality may be related because both rely to a large extent on your ability to lower your filters and inhibitions. Filters and inhibitions stifle the production of new ideas and tend to produce ideas that hew to accepted norms and standards, rather than the creative or unusual ideas that might unstick you. Jeff Tweedy’s approach to creativity is grounded in a similar kind of disinhibition: the importance of switching off the judgmental voice in your head that forces you to question the quality of your ideas even as you’re generating them. Bad ideas are the essential foundations, Tweedy suggests, on which good ideas are built. The simple rule is that you should allow yourself to think and act “badly,” “wrongly,” and “poorly,” particularly if lowering the bar gives you permission to think and act more fluently and reliably than you otherwise might. There’s nothing wrong with being wrong if wrongness reliably predicts the arrival of rightness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Learning by doing — Hamilton Naki’s life</strong>:<br><br>One hallmark of learning is “wrongness that reliably precedes rightness,” and broadly speaking there are two ways to learn new things.

His formal education was limited by apartheid and opportunity. Naki’s six years of schooling came to a close when he was fourteen, and he eventually moved seven hundred miles west to work as a gardener in Cape Town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Naki’s ascent — from gardener to surgical master through action</strong>:<br><br>As a Black man in apartheid South Africa, Naki was forbidden from pursuing a range of elite professions. It would have been difficult for him to study, let alone to practice, law or medicine, for example, but from a young age Naki had an eye on the medical profession. As he was forced to observe from a distance, the closest he got to a medical career in those early days was to tend the grounds of the University of Cape Town. One day, when Naki was in his late twenties, a surgeon approached the gardening foreman asking for help with a range of basic lab duties. Naki was working that day, and soon he was feeding, cleaning, and anesthetizing animals in the university’s research lab.<br><br>Naki split his time between gardening and lab work, but the medical lab captured his imagination. Over time, he spent more and more time in the lab, attempting and then mastering increasingly technical procedures that were generally reserved for advanced students or even medical graduates. Naki was unusually dexterous, a skill he so honed that eminent surgeons sought him out as an anesthesia assistant. Eventually, he became the lab’s principal surgical aide. In the mid-1960s, Naki began working with heart surgeon Christiaan Barnard. Barnard was a star transplant surgeon, and the head of the university’s department of experimental surgery. In 1967, Barnard would perform the world’s first human-to-human heart transplant on a fifty-five-year-old man with incurable heart disease. (Naki didn’t attend the transplant procedure, though at his death in 2005 a number of reports and obituaries claimed in error that he acted as Barnard’s surgical partner.) Barnard’s opinion carried tremendous weight, and he praised Naki publicly and often. “Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did,” Barnard said some years later. “He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theater.” During another interview, Barnard described Naki as “one of the great researchers of all time in the field of heart transplants…. If Hamilton had had the chance to study, he probably would have become a brilliant surgeon.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Naki’s legacy — teaching, innovation, and action-based mastery</strong>:<br><br>Though Naki never operated directly on humans, he pioneered a number of surgical techniques and taught thousands of medical students. Eventually, he left Barnard’s lab to specialize in liver transplantation. Naki eventually taught Del Khan, who became the head of the university hospital’s organ-transplant department. “A liver transplant on a pig in the US would involve a team of two or three medically qualified surgeons,” Khan said during an interview. “Hamilton can do this all on his own.” Ralph Kirsch, the head of the hospital’s liver-research unit, described Naki as “one of those remarkable men who really come around once in a long time. As a man without any education, he mastered surgical techniques at the highest level and passed them on to young doctors.” Naki’s career was therefore a triumph of <em>action</em> over passive learning—of doing over simply consuming information. In an era when the color of his skin was a major sticking point, what unstuck Naki was a combination of opportunity and experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Action’s social effects — pioneers license followers</strong>:<br><br>Naki’s story is both personal and sociological. He overcame individual barriers, but also challenged the juggernaut of apartheid as one of the first Black men to approach the peak of the medical research field in South Africa. It’s almost impossible to shatter systemic barriers with thoughts and feelings alone, and what made Naki’s story irresistible to journalists and medical journals was the improbability of his ascent, and the concrete actions that carried him from the gardens at the University of Cape Town to its lecture halls and research labs. As Naki demonstrated, sometimes nothing short of action can convince people that a barrier is surmountable. In this sense, action unsticks at the level of populations just as it unsticks individuals. This was true of runner Roger Bannister, and mountaineer Edmund Hillary, two pioneers who changed how the world viewed their respective sports during a twelve-month period in the mid-1950s. Bannister ran a mile in three minutes and fifty-nine seconds in May 1954, breaking the four-minute barrier for the first time. The mile record had fallen dozens of times since the 1850s, but a race time that began with the digit <em>3</em> seemed impossible. The record barely budged for a decade, hovering around the four-minute-one-second mark between 1944 and 1954. But as soon as Bannister showed there was nothing magical about the four-minute mark, the record plunged. Just one month after his three fifty-nine, Australian John Landy ran the mile in three fifty-eight. By 1964, ten years after Bannister’s historic race, the record time had fallen five times, to three fifty-four.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Firsts, diffusion, and the licensing effect</strong>:<br><br>The same was true after Hillary reached the peak of Mount Everest with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, in 1953. When the two men ascended the mountain, they licensed others to break the same barrier. Soon a trickle and then a flood of climbers attempted the feat, and today more than five thousand mountaineers have summited Everest. A successful act—particularly an audacious act that surmounts conspicuous boundaries—unsticks others who may be game to try themselves, but prefer to be second or third movers rather than pioneers. Only a particular and rare personality tackles the kinds of boundaries that Naki, Bannister, Hillary, and Norgay overcame in the 1950s and 1960s, but the obliteration of those barriers even once licenses others to try, too. Firsts are hard; seconds and thirds are slightly less daunting because the task is obviously possible; and the attempts that follow become progressively less threatening because they’re both anonymous and enjoy the confidence that comes from seeing others succeed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Synthesis — action as propulsive, educational, and social</strong>:<br><br>Acting is the king of unstickers because it is propulsive by definition. You can’t act and be inert, and as Jeff Tweedy observed, even writing deliberately bad poetry or courting failure more broadly brings delayed progress. Empty yourself of bad ideas and unskilled actions and you’ll learn to recognize their productive counterparts—and learn to be less judgmental as you progress from sticking point to breakthrough. But perhaps the strongest argument for acting is that it’s the best way to learn, and learning is the greatest unsticker. By learning to recognize the difference between what works and what doesn’t, we become better thinkers, partners, parents, friends, entrepreneurs, artists, writers, and musicians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="12 ACTION ABOVE ALL — EXPANDED (≈20,000 characters; ~80% verbatim from provided passage)"> <strong>Practical checklist — converting theory into practice</strong>:<br><br>1.

Action above all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 29</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
