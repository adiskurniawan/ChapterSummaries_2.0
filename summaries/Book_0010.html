That biological push is adaptive for immediate physical danger but often counterproductive for complex cognitive problems. The deliberate opposite—slowing, exhaling, and doing less—restores prefrontal control, widens perception, reduces noise from threat circuitry, and opens access to creative and strategic cognition.

Exceptional talent often looks like an act of revolution—a person doing something in a way no one has ever done it before—but many revolutionary talents are actually built on a foundation of evolutionary tweaks. These tweaks develop over time, often compensating for weaknesses and anxieties that might derail a lesser talent. Pausing before you play is one of those small, disciplined tweaks: an intentional, in-performance delay that reduces anxiety, increases information sampling, and converts acute pressure into tactical advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Messi — the in-game preparatory pause:</strong><br><br>Take the world’s best soccer player, an Argentinean named Lionel Messi. Messi has won more Ballon d’Or trophies, awarded to the best soccer player of the year, than any other player. He has scored more goals in a calendar year than any other living player, is the top all-time scorer in Spain’s La Liga, and has the highest goal ratio in the sport today, scoring almost once every match. When Messi left his longtime Spanish club, Barcelona, in August 2021, the club’s TV channel broadcast every goal Messi had scored for the club. The broadcast started at 11:15 p.m. and concluded at 4:30 a.m.—five hours featuring hundreds of goals that each lasted only seconds.<br><br>Messi is a soccer genius for many reasons. He scores effortlessly, is almost impossible to dispossess when he has the ball, and is unbelievably quick. In a sport known for diving, Messi abhors going to ground and instead uses his speed to dart around the stray legs that felled lesser players. But what makes Messi most impressive is his ability to “see” the game. He’s diminutive, at five feet, seven inches, but when he plays, Messi seems to tower high above the field, enjoying a tactical bird’s-eye view that allows him to see the game more sharply than the other twenty-one players on the field.<br><br>For all his brilliance, though, he’s famously anxious. For several years, Messi habitually vomited on the field before big matches. Argentina’s coach at the time, Alejandro Sabella, explained, “In these moments, it’s anxiety more than anything.” Messi admits to being anxious on the field. When Argentina defeated Ecuador, 1–0, in its first match after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, in October 2020, he attributed his and the team’s slow start to “nervousness.” After a string of disappointing national-team losses, another former Argentinean coach and giant of the game, the late Diego Maradona, uncharitably criticized Messi by suggesting that it was “useless trying to make a leader out of a man who goes to the toilet twenty times before a game.” Being incredibly talented doesn’t immunize you against anxiety, and many of the world’s best grapple with anxiety precisely because they expect so much from themselves. But Messi hasn’t allowed his anxiety to diminish his brilliance because he’s mastered a coping mechanism that also doubles as the secret behind his tactical brilliance.<br><br>A soccer match runs for ninety minutes (plus a few minutes for “injury time”), and most players are active in the game from the first minute. As soon as the whistle blows, they implore their teammates to pass the ball, and pursue the tactics their coaches laid out before the game. But Messi is famous for <em>not</em> playing the game during its opening minutes. This is his evolutionary tweak, which developed as he played the game at progressively higher levels. For the opening minutes, Messi ambles back and forth near the middle of the field and almost never engages with his teammates. Whereas other players run and sometimes sprint, Messi spends much of his time walking, rarely breaking into more than a slow jog. “Messi shows little interest in the ball during the game’s opening exchanges,” one soccer writer observed. “Instead, he prowls about, barely leaving indents on the turf, watching closely for weaknesses and vulnerabilities.” </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Two-fold benefit — calm + scouting:</strong><br><br>Messi does two things during these first few minutes. First, he calms himself. Easing into the game is Messi’s way of ensuring he’s fully engaged for the remainder of the game. This is how he deals with the anxieties that crippled him earlier in his career. His on-field vomiting has resolved itself, in part perhaps because he’s found a more effective way to calm his nerves. Second, he spends this time scoping out the opposition. His legs move slowly, but his eyes dart from player to player, assessing his opponents’ strengths, weaknesses, and tactics, and monitoring his own team’s movement with and around the ball. Messi is less valuable to his team early in the game, but this tactical pause elevates his value for the remaining 95 percent of the game. Messi’s coaches at Spanish club Barcelona, where he spent the first eighteen years of his professional career, accepted his early idleness for the benefits it produced later. “Right, left, left, right. He smells who is the weak point of the back four,” recalled former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. “After five, ten minutes, he has the map. He knows if I move here, I will have more space to attack.” According to another Barcelona coach, Ernesto Valverde, Messi watches every movement of the opposition’s play during those early minutes, looking in particular for weaknesses that he might exploit later. Some players study hard before the game, learning the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents from recorded footage or by reading expert analyses. Messi prefers to form his opinions on the day because strengths and weaknesses change from day to day, and players react differently as their team lineups evolve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Behavioral pattern & outcome evidence:</strong><br><br>If you split soccer game play into “preparatory” and “engaged” components, Messi leans heavily on preparation. During one classic game between Messi’s Barcelona and archrivals Real Madrid, in 2017, Messi ran for just four minutes and walked for more than eighty of the game’s ninety minutes. When he was engaged, though, he was dynamic, creating nine chances, scoring one goal, and feeding the ball to a teammate who scored another goal. That pattern isn’t unusual for Messi, and it’s often in the biggest games that he accentuates his in-game preparation. That preparation also explains his ability to find himself in the right place at the right time, over and over. Though his positional play appears otherworldly, it isn’t a miracle; it’s that he’s learned, minute by minute, that a particular defender leaves a particular square of pitch uncovered, or that two midfielders leave a small corner of the pitch open when they gravitate to the middle of the field. “Surely it must mean something,” mused Irish soccer commentator Ken Early, “that the best player in the fastest era of football hardly ever runs at all.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Agassi — forensic pause & the tell:</strong><br><br>Messi’s assiduous preparation, even in the midst of competition, isn’t unique. In contrast to Messi’s consistency, the career of tennis star Andre Agassi was patchy. Between bouts of brilliance, Agassi contended with drug use, extended injuries, and high-profile romantic entanglements. At age twenty, early in his career, Agassi lost an important match because, in his telling, he was worried that his long-haired wig might fall off during the match.<br><br>When Agassi did succeed, though, he succeeded big. By the time his long career ended, he was the only male tennis player to have achieved the so-called Super Slam, winning all six of the biggest tennis tournaments: Australian Open, Roland-Garros (French Open), Wimbledon, US Open, ATP Finals, and Olympic Games. Agassi was a talented striker of the ball, but his biggest weapon was cerebral. He planned, analyzed, and interpreted the game meticulously.<br><br>One of Agassi’s notable rivals was Boris Becker, a German star who was famous for his tremendous serve. “Boris Becker beat me the first three times we played,” Agassi remembered, “because his service motion was something the game had never seen before.” Becker’s service motion was indeed unique, combining a deep knee bend and a whipping follow-through at full extension to produce one of the game’s fastest serves. Agassi was stuck, unsure of how to combat Becker’s serve, and he admitted publicly to avoiding games against Becker whenever possible. The rivalry left him anxious, so he turned to a different tactic that mirrored Messi’s approach: paying close attention to every aspect of Becker’s service motion. Was there a key, Agassi wondered, to returning Becker’s serves more reliably?<br><br>The breakthrough lay in a barely perceptible movement that preceded each of Becker’s serves. In an interview nearly thirty years later, Agassi explained the insight that turned their rivalry upside down: he watched tape after tape and noticed Becker’s tiny tongue tic—an almost imperceptible pre-serve cue. Agassi turned to videotapes of Becker’s matches to confirm his hunch and discovered that Becker’s tongue was a perfect guide to the position of his serve. After losing their first three matches, Agassi won nine of their next eleven. Becker was puzzled by the turnaround, as Agassi recalled: “I told Boris about this after he retired. I couldn’t help but say, ‘By the way, did you know that you used to do this when you served?’ He about fell off the chair, and he said, ‘I used to go home all the time and just tell my wife, ‘It’s like he reads my mind,’ ’ and he said to me, ‘Little did I know you were just reading my tongue.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Honnold — rehearsal, aborts, and safe stuckness:</strong><br><br>Messi and Agassi were anxious for different reasons—one temperamentally, and the other in the face of overwhelming opposition—but both broke through by deliberately preparing and pausing. The very best athletes in any sport create the illusion of ease—the sense that they’re achieving great heights without exerting much effort. In the moment that may be true, but the illusion of ease requires considerable planning.<br><br>This lesson is perhaps most stark with Alex Honnold, the free solo climber whose preparation ensured he was stuck at the right time—during practice, with ropes and partners—so that when it mattered he was free to act. Honnold rehearsed each pitch, sometimes dozens of times with ropes, rehearsed the mental sequence of moves, and developed explicit abort rules. He knew when to turn back, and he knew when preparation afforded a near-zero surprise climb. His meticulous pause-before-action made the impossible possible.

In addiction treatment, RAIN teaches people to recognize cravings, allow them to exist without immediate reaction, investigate sensations with curiosity, and note changes—lengthening the interval between urge and action. Brewer trained himself and others in prolonged sits to simulate two-hour cigarette abstinence periods. Those long sits—practiced pauses—worked. His clinical trials showed mindfulness-based pauses produced durable behavior change: patients using RAIN remained clean at higher rates than other treatment arms.

Pauses are a mechanism for information processing, emotional regulation, and social recalibration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr><tr><td data-label="5 PAUSE BEFORE YOU PLAY"> <strong>Mechanisms — how pausing improves outcomes:</strong><br><br>1.

Implement metrics, train teams with progressive desensitization, and protect early-stage experiments from evaluative scrutiny so that pausing is rewarded rather than penalized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 22</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table3" data-table="Book_0010_03" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></div>

Maybe your body’s moving too fast through space, or you’ve bitten off more than you can chew at work, or your reptilian brain has detected a dangerous situation that hasn’t yet tickled your forebrain. Sometimes that warning system is productive, driving you to fix immediate problems that might otherwise escape your notice. At other times, though, anxiety freezes you in place, or swells wildly even in the face of minor concerns. At these times anxiety entrenches rather than frees you.<br><br>Much of the anxiety you feel when you’re stuck is of this unhelpful kind. It flourishes in the face of friction when you misinterpret a modest or brief setback as a profound or extended threat. Anxiety is a natural response to resistance, but some people, through experience, strategy, or personality, marshal or move beyond this form of anxiety. It’s worth asking what separates them from the rest of us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Wealth as temporal freedom — a diagnostic lens:</strong><br><br>What would happen if you rolled over early one Monday morning, refused to turn on your phone, and went back to sleep for twelve hours?

How much will you lose for embracing a single day of gross and unplanned inefficiency?<br><br>Your answer to this question is an important measure of your personal wealth. If you have billions of dollars, but your decision to sleep late one day topples multinational organizations or governments, by this measure you’re a pauper. If you’re comfortably middle-class, but have vast tracts of temporal freedom, by this measure you’re immensely wealthy.<br><br>Most of the time we don’t equate wealth with freedom. Instead, we treat people as ongoing balance sheets. The Forbes 400 list exemplifies this approach. In 1981, Malcolm Forbes asked his editor in chief to compile a list of the four hundred wealthiest people in America. Forbes, like his father, who founded the magazine in 1917, was a fan of capitalism and free markets. He collected Fabergé eggs, yachts, airplanes, and motorcycles and was himself worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Forbes chose the number four hundred because rumor had it that Caroline Astor’s famous ballroom held four hundred people. A small team of <em>Forbes</em> writers traversed the country for leads. They walked up and down New York’s fabled Park and Fifth Avenues looking for names that appeared on more than one building cornerstone and conducted hundreds of interviews with bankers, journalists, and fundraisers. To make the first list, moguls needed to demonstrate a net worth of around $100 million (today it’s closer to $2 billion). The members of that inaugural class were a mix of delighted and irritated. Media giant Malcolm Borg complained, “Every goddamn stockbroker in the country has called me,” whereas real estate baron William Horvitz said his inclusion made him “feel pretty good deep inside.”<br><br>When you dig into the list, though, you’ll find hundreds of people who have huge sums of money, but relatively little time. The complex financial lives that bring them billions leave them almost none of what researchers call “time slack,” or temporal freedom.

If they don’t “love the hustle,” if they’re incapable of rising to the top of a multinational behemoth or finding a start-up that will “change everything,” they’ve lost. That view of the world imposes colossal pressure. It leaves no margin for inefficiency. No slack. The hustle requires that you sacrifice relationships, weekends, and, above all, happiness today as you stumble toward the mirage of happiness tomorrow.<br><br>If this is your outlook, you’ll feel near-constant setbacks, and those setbacks will provoke piercing anxiety.

Albert Einstein was obscenely productive, but his productivity came in bursts. Between those bursts, he was gentle with himself. “If my work isn’t going well,” he said, “I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination.” Try to imagine Einstein, white mane and all, lying on his back and staring at the blank ceiling at two in the afternoon. This isn’t the Einstein of myth, but it’s central to what made him great. Rather than fighting friction, Einstein allowed it to wash over him like a wave, using it as an opportunity to take two or three mental steps backward so he could “listen” to his imagination. Instead of fighting friction, he allowed it to defeat him—and, in doing so, learned to fail well.<br><br>The same was true of Mozart, who allowed himself to slow down between bursts of productivity. Mozart found the best of his compositions arrived when he was most placid. “When I am, as it were, completely myself,” he wrote, “entirely alone, and of good cheer—say, traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep—it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.” Mozart may have experienced fevered bursts of productivity, but those bursts are hard to sustain. You don’t make a string of breakthroughs, composing six hundred symphonies and concertos, by wrestling your demons every time your productivity hits a wall. Like Einstein, Mozart recognized that the quickest way to guide a derailed mind toward productivity is not to exert brute force, but to seek space and solitude—and to accept that some failure is necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>The Goldilocks zone — optimal failure rate:</strong><br><br>One of the benefits of this laid-back approach to friction is that it makes room for failure. It accepts that we can’t always produce at peak productivity, and that highs will be separated by lows. Modern theories of learning and development acknowledge that progress is impossible without challenge, which in turn means you’ll have to fail before you can succeed.<br><br>Several years ago, a team of psychologists and neuroscientists sought to identify the perfect success-to-failure ratio. At one end of the spectrum, you have perfect success, and at the other you have abject failure. Both poles are demotivating, but for different reasons. Perfect success is boring and uninspiring, and abject failure is exhausting and demoralizing. Somewhere between these extremes is a sweet spot that maximizes long-term progress. “When we learn something new, like a language or musical instrument,” the authors wrote, “we often seek challenges at the edge of our competence—not so hard that we are discouraged, but not so easy that we get bored. This simple intuition, that there is a sweet spot of difficulty, a ‘Goldilocks zone,’ for motivation and learning is at the heart of modern teaching methods.”<br><br>According to the researchers, the optimal error rate is 15.87 percent. Obviously the true rate varies more than that disarmingly precise number suggests. On good days you might tolerate a higher error rate, and on days when you’re discouraged or tired, you might prefer to avoid error altogether. Some tasks probably demand higher failure rates than others, and perhaps you need to embrace more failure if you’re in a hurry to learn. Personality probably matters, too. Einstein and Mozart, with their laid-back approach to friction, may have been more willing to tolerate error than most people are, and that may explain a part of their ongoing success.<br><br>What makes the mere existence of this optimal failure rate valuable is that it does two things for you. First, it gives you an objective benchmark for optimal difficulty. If you’re failing much more than once in every five or six attempts, you’re probably failing too often; and if you almost never fail or fail rarely, you’re probably not failing often enough. Second, though, from an emotional perspective, the optimal error rate licenses you to fail. Not only is failing okay, but it’s <em>necessary.</em> Without those moments staring at their literal and metaphorical ceilings, Einstein and Mozart may have been less productive and less successful across time. Those blips and troughs weren’t glitches but rather essential components of the process.                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Failing well — what it requires:</strong><br><br>Failing well is critical because it’s rarely the last thing you do. It’s almost always a waypoint on an extended journey, the remainder of which is shaped by how you respond to that failure. What’s critical is that you respond to failure productively, and one of the major differences between successes and setbacks is that most people respond to successes similarly, whereas failures invoke a diverse array of responses. Most people know how to celebrate victory, and to celebrate it well. We’re taught not to gloat as children, and for most of us the lesson takes quite early. Oscar winners, Grammy recipients, and Olympic gold medalists are groomed to win gracefully, and so from a young age we see them behaving respectably over and over when they win. It’s easy to be gracious in victory, but it’s rarer to see grace in defeat.<br><br>Much of what determines whether you respond to setbacks with grace is how you interpret those experiences. In “Failing and Flying,” American poet Jack Gilbert suggested that we tend to ignore successes and train our attention on failure. Gilbert illustrates this idea by reframing the legend of Icarus. “Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew,” he begins, noting that we universally remember Icarus for plunging to the earth after straying too close to the sun. Gilbert concludes the poem with the lines “I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell, / but just coming to the end of his triumph.” What Gilbert wrote is true about humans in general. Most of the time, when we focus our attention on losses, failures, and mistakes, we’re protected from repeating our mistakes and from making risky decisions. But when we’re trying to unstick ourselves, focusing on negatives entrenches us more deeply.<br><br>Gilbert’s answer is to train our attention on the successes that brought us to where we became stuck. In many cases, being stuck is a sign of progress—of having moved beyond a place of comfort and mastery to a place where you’re challenged. The key is to remember that straying to more difficult terrain invites setbacks, but those setbacks are essential for progress in the long run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Hardship inoculation & overtraining examples:</strong><br><br>Setbacks may be inevitable, but the anxiety that follows them is surmountable. One way to ensure you don’t respond to every setback with anxiety is to expose yourself to stress tests that steel you against setbacks. This approach is popular among athletes. Elite golfers know that transient losses of focus threaten otherwise impeccable scores. If you’re expecting to hit seventy-two shots during a round of golf, just one lapse—on, say, the fiftieth shot—might add two, three, or four extra strokes to your round. A full round of eighteen holes might last four or more hours, so distraction and fatigue are almost inevitable. When American golfer Phil Mickelson isn’t playing championship golf, he taxes his attentional skills by playing at least two rounds a day. “I’m making more and more progress by trying to elongate my focus,” Mickelson has said. “I might try to play thirty-six, forty-five holes in a day and try to focus on each shot so that when I go out and play eighteen, it doesn’t feel like it’s that much.” If Mickelson trains himself to hit two hundred shots without losing focus, he should be able to hit the seventy-odd shots during a standard day of championship golf. “I’m trying to use my mind like a muscle and just expand it,” he said. This approach rests on the idea that humans are tremendously flexible. For most golfers, focusing for eighteen straight holes is a significant challenge, but eighteen holes constitutes just 40 percent of Mickelson’s training diet.<br><br>Mickelson’s overtraining technique worked to delay his physical and mental fatigue on the course, and the same approach also drives emotional resilience. To test this idea, three of my colleagues and I examined the performance of college basketball teams across a ten-year period. Before each season’s competitive games begin, college teams play a series of noncompetitive preseason games. These are “friendly” games, which means the stakes are low. They’re designed to ready each team for the rigors of competition, and the results aren’t officially tallied. What’s important about these preseason games is that they’re randomly drawn. Some years, a team might play a collection of formidable opponents, and other years the same team might play a string of weaker opponents. We wondered whether teams do better during the competitive season when they play weaker opponents or when they play stronger opponents during the preseason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Preseason difficulty and competitive performance:</strong><br><br>The answer isn’t obvious. We interviewed coaching experts and elite college athletes across a range of sports, and their opinions varied. Some said they preferred light preseason schedules, which would instill confidence ahead of the competitive season. What could be better, heading into a new season, than winning your entire slate of preseason games? You might also experience fewer injuries, and you’d be able to rest your strongest players for competition.<br><br>Other coaches and players believed the opposite: that challenging preseasons were critical for team preparation. If you’re playing weaker teams, you won’t have an opportunity to refine the strategies you’ll need when you meet elite teams during the competitive season. Some told us, too, that it’s important to learn how to lose. Losing is inevitable—even strong teams usually lose a game or two each season or tournament—so learning how to rebound from loss is an essential skill. Some coaches worried that their teams might head into a tailspin following a loss, which might turn that single loss into two or three before the team regained its balance. The best way to deal with that concern is to lose when losing doesn’t matter quite so much.<br><br>This latter approach is known as hardship inoculation. The term, borrowed from the treatment of infectious diseases, suggests that our bodies and minds become more resilient to formidable challenges when they’ve been inoculated against those challenges. The best way to inoculate your body against a disease is to expose it to small or inert doses of the disease before the real disease arrives. Hardship inoculation applies to setbacks, too. Across ten seasons, we found that college basketball teams performed better during competitive games following challenging preseason schedules. The effect was large, too. Our model suggests that teams with the easiest preconference schedules might have reached a round or even two rounds deeper into the postseason knockout tournament had they drawn one of the most difficult preconference schedules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Hardship inoculation beyond sports — Go AI & exposure therapy:</strong><br><br>Hardship inoculation works in intellectual domains, as well. Humans have been playing the complex Chinese board game of Go for thousands of years, and though performance has improved across time, it has to a large extent stagnated over the past several decades. That was true until sometime between 2016 and 2017, when a new artificially intelligent Go engine surpassed the ability of all human Go players. The best human players in the world routinely lost to the Go AI, but these losses paved the way for a new era in the game. For years, human skills had seemed to hit a ceiling, but after the AI’s introduction, the entire field of Go players seemed to improve. They made better moves and achieved higher scores on the most commonly used rating scale. The hardship of facing a superior machine liberated a reservoir of ability that most Go players failed to tap earlier in their careers.<br><br>Beyond sports and intellectual pursuits, you can also inoculate yourself against emotional challenges. One person who knows this firsthand is Michelle Poler, a brand strategist and founder of the Hello Fears movement. Poler was an anxious child, raised in an anxious family. Her ancestors had fled Nazism during World War II for a new life in Venezuela, and many of their anxieties remained half a century later as Poler was growing up in Caracas. “My mom was raised with lots of fears, and so was I,” she says. “And while our fears may not overlap, we both had the same attitude toward fear: if it’s there, don’t bother!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Michelle Poler — 100 days without fear:</strong><br><br>In 2014, Poler overcame a basket of fears to move to New York City, where she began a master’s in branding at the School of Visual Arts. During the first day of class, her professor asked her two questions that changed her life. First, the teacher asked where Poler imagined herself ten years in the future. Poler’s list included becoming a successful entrepreneur, traveling with her husband, speaking at companies around the world, and buying an apartment in Manhattan. Second, the teacher asked whether one crucial obstacle might prevent Poler from achieving those outcomes. The answer arrived in capital letters: FEAR. “Fear was the one obstacle that could prevent me from achieving my ten-year plan,” Poler realized. “How could I apply to the best companies in NYC if I was so afraid of rejection? How could I then become an entrepreneur if I couldn’t deal with uncertainty? How would I ever be able to speak at conferences about my ‘accomplishments’ if I was terribly scared of public speaking? I wanted all of those things, but I was dreadfully afraid of them.”<br><br>Poler had never heard the term <em>hardship inoculation</em>, but she recognized that her dreams might elude her unless she learned to tolerate her anxiety. Her choice was either to do nothing and to remain insulated from fear, or to learn to manage her fears in the service of that ten-year plan. She chose the path of inoculation, and so began her “one hundred days without fear” campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Exposure, tracking, and learning:</strong><br><br>Each day, for one hundred days, Poler did something that scared her. Some of those fears revolved around pain and danger, others around embarrassment, rejection, and loneliness, and others around control and disgust. She began by eating three oysters at her parents’ anniversary dinner at New York’s Balthazar restaurant. “I’m afraid of eating things that look, feel or smell disgusting,” she explained on her website. “In an effort to stay away from that uncomfortable situation, I embrace my safe food area which includes: pizza, mac’n’cheese, crunchy tuna roll, arepas, cereal and delicious looking things without eyes, tentacles or shells.” Poler captured the experience on video. It didn’t go well. She gagged a couple of times, spat out the first oyster, and had to steel herself before washing down another oyster with a slurp of red wine.<br><br>Poler still detests oysters, and she doesn’t believe that eating oysters, specifically, has anything to do with her ten-year plan. Embracing her fears, though, inoculated her against the legitimate challenges she might face as she tackled that plan. Eating oysters was her preseason, and she had begun with a particularly difficult assignment. Poler’s list of fears was diverse. On day fourteen she drove alone through the streets of Miami at night. On day twenty-six she took a helicopter ride. On day thirty-five she spoke in front of a crowd, and on day thirty-nine she donated blood. Later, she crowd-surfed, crashed a wedding, did stand-up comedy, flew a plane, rappelled down a cliff, and—on day one hundred—delivered a TEDx Talk in front of almost five hundred people. The experiences changed her. After the project ended, Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo invited her to its Miami studios for an interview. She was incredibly nervous. She was still afraid of public speaking, and particularly afraid of live TV—and her worst fears were realized when the interview went horribly wrong. “I suddenly forgot how to speak Spanish (my first language),” she recalled. “I started using many words in English, which I shouldn’t have. I was just so nervous that I couldn’t think well.” When her interviewer revealed that Poler would be taking a surprise trip to Poland, to take part in the International March of the Living (a march between concentration camps Auschwitz and Birkenau to commemorate the Holocaust), she froze and struggled to regain her composure. But—and this is critical—she not only survived the embarrassment of that interview but used it to gird her against future challenges. This was her new philosophy. Each time she was anxious or faced a barrier, she remembered the hundred-plus barriers she’d faced and overcome during the inoculation journey. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Exposure therapy, illusion of explanatory depth, and preparedness audits:</strong><br><br>Fear is such an elemental component of stuckness that Poler’s approach applies to more than just acute phobias. Whether a sticking point involves a difficult conversation, a leap from one career path to another, or anxiety about attempting a new skill, Poler’s twist on exposure therapy is a valuable tool. On one level, it shows the value of taking on manageable doses of anxiety on the way to growing past a roadblock. On another, more profound level, it suggests that we become globally more resilient to roadblocks when we adopt Poler’s philosophy. Once you take on a couple of your fears, you become the kind of person who faces rather than runs from fear. When a new roadblock-driven anxiety arrives, you’re primed to meet its challenge.<br><br>As time passes, Poler continues to expose herself to new fears, in part to ensure she’s still inoculated. Extending the inoculation metaphor further, these new exposures are like antibody tests that confirm her immunity. That’s an important part of the process, too—ensuring that you know whether and to what extent you can manage the anxiety of new setbacks. Living constantly in fear isn’t for everyone, but there’s another way to determine whether you’ve been inoculated. This technique draws on a psychological phenomenon known as the illusion of explanatory depth. The illusion works like this: Ask yourself right now how well you can explain how a bicycle works and give yourself a rating. A rating of one means you have no idea how a bicycle works (and may not even know what a bicycle is), and a rating of ten means you could explain its operation perfectly. Most people give themselves a score of six or seven, which means they believe they can do a reasonable job of explaining how a bicycle works. Now try, in words, to explain how a bicycle works. Really try.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Interrogating knowledge and plans — resilience test:</strong><br><br>Most people know that a bike has handlebars, wheels, a chain, gears, and pedals, but in explaining how the bike works, they falter. They’re not sure how those components interact with one another, how they produce movement, whether and how the chain is connected to the pedals and the gears, and so on. This is the illusion. Unquestioned, we assume we know how a bicycle works, but when pushed to <em>unpack</em> our knowledge, we struggle. The same is true of many other mechanical devices, like ballpoint pens and zippers, and even of the policy positions held by prominent politicians. Most of the time these shortcomings are hidden from view. We mistake our superficial understanding of <em>what</em> a bike is for <em>how</em> a bike works. The only way to reveal this deficit is to interrogate it—to ask ourselves the way a child might to unpack our knowledge. Only when you’re forced to fully express your knowledge do you realize what you don’t know.<br><br>Coping with setbacks is similar in that we rarely question how we’d manage the anxiety of friction before that friction is real. Michelle Poler’s campaign was effective because it showed her precisely what she could and couldn’t manage and made her more resilient. As she progressed through the hundred days, she recorded how she felt before, during, and after each challenge. While eating the oysters, her fear rose to a ten on her ten-point scale, but afterward receded to a six. In contrast, going to a dog park scared her in anticipation (an eight), but was less scary in the moment (a six), and not at all scary in retrospect (a three). These numbers matter because they told Poler two different stories about these two specific fears: she continues to fear oysters and has no plans to eat one again, but can imagine spending time among dogs. “I don’t think you overcome such fear in so little time,” she wrote, “but I do believe this helped me understand that dogs don’t want to hurt me, they just want to have fun.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Scaling failure tolerance — organizational constraints:</strong><br><br>These techniques, from hardship inoculation to exposure therapy, work at the individual level, but they’re difficult to scale. It’s almost impossible to deal with the anxiety of getting stuck in an organization or among a collection of people with solutions that don’t change the structure of the organization or the collection at large. To do that you need to give people within the collective room to fail. The rule of thumb in classrooms goes something like this: praise students three times more often than you reprimand them. This ratio implies that you can spoil students with too much praise. Several years ago, a team of education experts put this ratio to the test. They followed teachers and students for three years across nineteen elementary schools across the United States. Some of the teachers were taught to praise their students more freely, whereas others were left to manage their classrooms as they always had. The researchers monitored the behavior of the students in each classroom.<br><br>As the data trickled in, it became clear that the students thrived on praise. The three-to-one ratio ceiling was a fiction. In some classrooms teachers offered nine times more praise than criticism, and those were the classrooms in which the students did best. They were more likely to remain on task the more praise and the less criticism they received.

One study examined the extent to which abusive NBA coaches shaped the careers of the young players on their teams. The study tracked the performance of hundreds of players coached by fifty-seven coaches across six years. The results were unambiguous. Players with abusive coaches were less efficient and committed more technical fouls even ten years after escaping those coaches. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that abuse is counterproductive, but what is surprising is that it continues to damage athletes for the remainder of their careers. This result is concerning, too, because a second study found that between one-sixth and one-third of all college basketball coaches are abusive, implying that the damage might be done even before young athletes fully mature.<br><br>Praise in the classroom and on the basketball court is effective because it counteracts the anxiety that students and athletes might otherwise feel as they develop. It licenses them to fail, and to take risks, both of which tend to provoke anxiety, but both of which are critical for the breakthroughs that follow periods of learning and development.

Indeed, the SEALs who believed stress predicted achievement were more likely to persist through training, to complete obstacle courses more quickly, and to receive fewer negative evaluations from their peers and instructors.

UBIs are negative taxes that are paid to every member of a region or country—say, $1,000 a month with no strings attached. One of the strongest arguments in favor of UBIs is that they liberate people to take entrepreneurial risks that they might otherwise avoid. If you want to start a new business, for example, and you know you won’t be earning an income for several months or longer as the business grows, the UBI frees you to take that risk, whereas the absence of an income would prevent you from embarking on the venture. One of the most consistent findings from UBI trials, over many decades, is that they reduce anxiety and liberate people to focus on more than putting food on the table each week.<br><br>Before writing the first book in the Harry Potter series, J. K. Rowling was destitute. What saved her was a guaranteed income from government benefits. In an interview with Jon Stewart, she explained the importance of this: “I couldn’t have written this book if I hadn’t been as poor as it’s possible to go in the UK without being homeless. We were on what you would call welfare, what I would call benefits, for a couple of years.” Stewart asked Rowling whether the government had ever made a better investment than supporting her during those years. Rowling replied, “Absolutely, my country helped me, and there are places in the world where I would have starved.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>UBI trials, entrepreneurship, and New Leaf outcomes:</strong><br><br>A similar UBI policy in Nigeria has been wildly successful. In 2011, the Nigerian government gave $60 million to twelve hundred entrepreneurs who were launching new ventures—a total of roughly $50,000 per venture. Three years after the program launched, 54 percent of a group of unfunded entrepreneurs were still running their businesses, whereas 93 percent of those in the program had thriving businesses. Those businesses were also more than three times as likely to have grown beyond ten employees. The money helps in part because it simply gives people the resources to start new ventures, but it also helps because it’s freeing. Most acts of entrepreneurship and innovation are risky, and risk-taking is less intimidating to the privileged. If a risk exposes you to financial ruin, it’s far more daunting than if you have a financial cushion beneath you. One recipient of UBI explained that a regular paycheck emboldened her to be more entrepreneurial: “It gave me the security to start my own business.” Dozens of other recipients have made similar claims, some likening the experience to “winning the lottery.”<br><br>Perhaps the most compelling argument for the unsticking effects of UBI programs comes from the New Leaf program in British Columbia, Canada. The program, founded by the University of British Columbia and a charitable organization called Foundations for Social Change, paid fifty homeless residents of Vancouver a onetime sum of $7,500 and tracked their behavior for one year. Recipients spent their money on a combination of food, rent, clothes, transportation, and medical bills, and the vast majority managed to retain more than $1,000 across the year, despite Vancouver’s high cost of living. A number of the recipients also felt liberated to pursue employment, signing up for classes and applying for new jobs. “My goal is to better myself,” one recipient named Ray told New Leaf. “I want to go into the front line for alcohol and drug abuse; to give back where I came from. I just started computer training, so I’m advancing myself.” Ray’s unsticking would be impossible had the program not taken care of his basic needs and, in turn, the anxiety he experienced being homeless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>From emotional mastery to smarter thinking about failure:</strong><br><br>Mastering your emotional response to friction is critical, but taming your anxiety is just the first step in getting unstuck.

</td></tr><tr><td data-label="6 FAILING WELL"> <strong>Summary & practical takeaways:</strong><br><br>- Recalibrate your relationship to failure: aim for a learning-rich error rate rather than zero-error perfection.<br>- Build temporal slack and safety nets to increase the room in which reversible failure can occur.<br>- Inoculate yourself via graduated exposure: practice low-stakes failure to build resilience for high-stakes moments.<br>- Normalize praise and psychological safety to enable risk-taking in groups and organizations.<br>- Reframe stress as a potential performance enhancer and provide tools (reappraisal, preparation) to turn anxiety into useful signal.<br><br>Failing well is a learned discipline: design environments, rituals, and personal practices that transform setbacks into fuel for durable progress.
