Those who remembered unique details of paintings improved dramatically in their performance, showing that recalling exceptional information activates intuition.                                                                                   </td></tr>

It allows acting in ways no one has previously envisioned, solving old problems in fresh ways. Modern interpretations often see it as mystical, but it has a natural, evidence-based source.                                                                                                                </td></tr>

These discoveries predated scientific validation and contributed to the RGB color wheel used in modern screens.                                                      </td></tr>

Anthropologists note early humans organized around natural leaders for hunting, defense, and survival. Schooling conditions people to follow instructions rather than trust intuition. Tests and grades reinforce obedience over initiative. Over time, societal validation—promotions, titles, accolades—can become a proxy for self-worth and undermine natural leadership instincts.                                                                          </td></tr>

Covert victories (quiet problem-solving behind the scenes) build self-reliance, focus, and intrinsic motivation.

Self-awareness: know strengths, weaknesses, triggers. <br>2. Empathy: recognize and validate others’ perspectives. <br>3. Social skill: resolve conflict, communicate, foster collaboration. <br>Example: a leader navigates team tension by acknowledging stress while keeping focus on objectives.                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>

Example: Edison’s iterative experiments show failure refines constraints and strategy. Fear of failure causes stagnation; embracing failure builds resilience, innovation, and long-term vision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>

Shakespearean story breaks formulaic rules, inspiring Romanticism and innovation in art, literature, and leadership.                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>
