Anthropologists note early humans organized around natural leaders for hunting, defense, and survival. Schooling conditions people to follow instructions rather than trust intuition. Tests and grades reinforce obedience over initiative. Over time, societal validation—promotions, titles, accolades—can become a proxy for self-worth and undermine natural leadership instincts.                                                                          </td></tr>

Self-awareness: know strengths, weaknesses, triggers. &lt;br&gt;2. Empathy: recognize and validate others’ perspectives. &lt;br&gt;3. Social skill: resolve conflict, communicate, foster collaboration. &lt;br&gt;Example: a leader navigates team tension by acknowledging stress while keeping focus on objectives.                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>

<tr><td data-label="Summary"><b>Leadership is a lifelong journey.</b>                       </td><td data-label="Notes">Leadership is a practice requiring continuous learning, reflection, and mentorship. Leaders regularly evaluate decisions, personal growth, trends, and development opportunities for others. Example: CEOs who read widely and mentor successors sustain organizational innovation over decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>
<tr><td data-label="Summary"><b>Ethics and integrity underpin sustainable leadership.</b>   </td><td data-label="Notes">Leadership without trust collapses. Ethical leaders prioritize long-term value over short-term gains. Companies led by principled leaders retain employee loyalty, public trust, and resilience in crises. Integrity aligns vision, influence, and action with moral standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr></tbody>
