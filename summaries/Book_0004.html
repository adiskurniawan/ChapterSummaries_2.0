This claim is defended by three converging arguments (neuroscience, evolution, and physics). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>Why one algorithm matters:</strong> Machine learning already uses very few algorithms to solve many tasks; the same learners (Naïve Bayes, nearest-neighbor, decision trees, Bayesian networks) power spam filters, medical diagnosis, handwriting recognition, and recommendation systems. </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Quotes / Examples">Examples given: Naïve Bayes can take patient records and learn diagnoses; the same algorithm family can learn spam filtering. Nearest-neighbor methods have been used for handwriting recognition, robot control, and recommender systems.

Practical learning requires assumptions (priors, model classes).

Thus memorization (lookup) cannot generalize—most future cases will be novel combinations. This motivates the need for generalization mechanisms, not rote recall. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>The “No Free Lunch” theorem:</strong> Formally captures Hume’s pessimism: averaged over all possible worlds, no learner outperforms random guessing unless it incorporates assumptions (bias).                                                    </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Quotes / Examples">David Wolpert’s theorem shows that for every world where a particular learner does well, there exists an “anti-world” where it does correspondingly poorly. Averaged across all worlds, learners tie. The practical response: we don’t care about all conceivable worlds—only the one we inhabit—so we must bake domain knowledge or inductive bias into learners. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>“Futility of bias-free learning”:</strong> Learning requires bias.

Without bias, learning is underdetermined (an “ill-posed” problem).

This is knowledge-driven generalization rather than blind induction. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>Overfitting = hallucination:</strong> Machine learners can “see” patterns that aren’t there because unconstrained search finds spurious regularities that fit the training set but fail out-of-sample.                                            </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Quotes / Examples">Overfitting arises when models adapt to noise. The text calls this machine hallucination: the model invents rules that only match observed data, not the underlying generative process. Symbolists avoid this by restricting the form of allowable rules (deduction, logic), reducing the chance of finding spurious fits. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>No single solution yet:</strong> Each ML “tribe” provides different inductive biases; Chapter 3 uses Hume + No Free Lunch to motivate why we’ll explore multiple approaches (symbolists, connectionists, Bayesians, evolutionaries, analogizers). </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Quotes / Examples">The Master Algorithm project doesn’t expect one currently known method to be sufficient; rather, we must examine tradeoffs across approaches because each encodes different priors that make it suitable for particular kinds of regularities in our world. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Summary / Core Concepts"><strong>Practical consequences for engineers:</strong> Don’t expect raw data to be enough—choose models that encode appropriate assumptions (smoothness, locality, compositionality, causal structure).                                                   </td><td data-label="Supporting Details / Quotes / Examples">The chapter advises practitioners: identify which assumptions your domain permits.
