The framework must enable compliance with donor terms and local law, enforce segregation of duties, maintain a clear audit trail, provide escalation routes for exceptions, and support continuous improvement. Governance is both policy and practice — controls must be embedded in day-to-day operations and evidenced. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — Financial Governance and Control"> <strong>Scope</strong><br>Applies to all legal entities, country offices, sub-offices, projects, programmes, partners, suppliers and staff involved in financial activities. Covers budgeting, commitments, procurement, contracting, payments, payroll, treasury, accounting, partner funding, asset management, reporting, internal controls, monitoring and audit. Excludes activities explicitly covered under separate statutory or donor-mandated governance frameworks where those rules are stricter — in such cases donor/statutory rules prevail and any deviation must be documented and approved. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — Financial Governance and Control"> <strong>Key definitions & core recognition principles</strong><br>• <strong>Governance:</strong> structures, policies and processes used to direct, manage and control the organisation’s financial affairs.<br>• <strong>Control environment:</strong> tone at the top, policies, organisational structures and human resource practices that underpin other controls.<br>• <strong>Segregation of duties (SoD):</strong> clear separation of initiation, approval, execution, recording and reconciliation tasks.<br>• <strong>Delegation of Authority (DoA):</strong> formal limits and authorities for spending, commitments and approvals.<br>• <strong>Materiality:</strong> thresholds for reporting, remediation and escalation based on financial and reputational impact.<br><strong>Core principle:</strong> apply risk-based, proportionate controls that are documented and independently verifiable. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — Financial Governance and Control"> <strong>Core governance principles</strong><br>1. <strong>Accountability:</strong> named individuals accept responsibility for actions and decisions;

Standard attributes, digit conventions and requirement summary: </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Attribute — Digits — Convention — Required</strong><br>• <strong>Account</strong> — 4 — Harmonised SCI chart of accounts — All transactions.<br>• <strong>Cost Centre</strong> — 5 — CCC00 — All transactions.<br>• <strong>Project</strong> — 7 — CCC0000 — All income & expenditure transactions.<br>• <strong>Source of funds (SOF)</strong> — 8 — MMM00000 — All income & expenditure and some balance sheet transactions.<br>• <strong>Donor expenditure analysis (DEA)</strong> — 6 (or 5 for pre-Apr2013) — 000000 unique code allocated by Agresso — All expenditure transactions.<br>• <strong>Analysis</strong> — Varies — See below — Only required for certain account codes.<br>• <strong>Lclcoa</strong> — Varies — Legal requirement in country, if needed — Only if legal requirement in country (rare).<br>• <strong>Country</strong> — 3 — CCC — All transactions (auto-populates based on cost centre).<br>Notes on conventions: CCC = country ISO code; MMM = member ISO code; '0' = placeholder digits to be assigned. Each posting attribute identifies aspects of the transaction (origin, award/funding source, project). Combining codes or using them as free codes (except lclcoa if legally required) is prohibited unless approved by Director of IP Finance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Cost centre</strong><br>• A cost centre allocates costs and normally represents a physical location (main office or sub-office).<br>• 5-digit code: first 3 digits = country ISO; last 2 digits = office identifier (e.g., CCC00 = main office; CCC01 = sub-office).<br>• Example: 03100 Azerbaijan main office; 03101 Ganja sub-office. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Project</strong><br>• 7-digit code identifying a specific activity/group of activities; required for all income & expenditure transactions.<br>• Examples: 0047112 Kandahar working children; 0500770 Flood emergency relief (Bangladesh).<br>• Definitions: project = an activity within a sub-thematic area in a specific context (lowest level of activity you wish to track).

Agresso rules link DEA to the correct SOF preventing posting to wrong SOF when correct DEA used.<br>• DEAs are based on donor report codes (DRCs) from fund summaries — giving reporting detail the country office must provide to donors. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Analysis (variable field)</strong><br>• Analysis field varies depending on account code chosen. The field name changes (e.g., account 5030 Vehicles → analysis field named 'vehicle' and must enter vehicle code; account 4920 Relocation expenses → analysis field named 'staff' and must enter staff ID number).<br>• Below is a list of common analysis types with coding convention and examples: </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Analysis attribute table (selected types)</strong><br>• <strong>SubAward</strong> — Identifies partner award; used for partner payments/advances — 5 digits — Created in AMS. Example: Food for Kids.<br>• <strong>Staff</strong> — Identifies SCI staff via Staff ID — format CCC000000000 (first 3 digits country where staff paid; remaining digits assigned by HR system; must NOT be 8 digits to avoid conflict with suppliers). Created in HR system. Example: John Paul Brown.<br>• <strong>Customer</strong> — Non-donor debtor (e.g., tenants or SC member) — CCC00000 (first 3 digits represent country where Customer created) — Created in Agresso. Example: Paul John Brown / Save the Children UK.<br>• <strong>Supplier</strong> — Organisational creditor or third-party receiving payment — CCC00000 for domestic (first 3 digits = country where supplier created) or 998 for international suppliers; remaining digits assigned consecutively. Created in Agresso. Example: Hotel Everest.<br>• <strong>Vehicle</strong> — Fixed asset vehicle code — CCCV0000 (V denotes vehicle) — Example: Nissan 4x4 XTrail.<br>• <strong>Property</strong> — Owned/leased property code — CCCP0000 (P denotes property) — Example: SCI Centre Floor 1.<br>• <strong>Other asset</strong> — Asset that is neither vehicle nor property — CCCA0000 (A denotes asset) — Example: Dell computer model DCCY S/N: 3839V2J.<br>• <strong>Bank</strong> — Bank account used in bank transactions — CCC00 (first 3 digits = country where bank located; remaining 2 digits for account number) — Include bank name, account number and currency. Example: Nepal 90744158 Barclays NPR current.<br>• <strong>Petty cash</strong> — Cash holding/petty cash fund — CCC000 (first 5 digits represent cost centre where cash holding is based, followed by 1 digit) — Created in Agresso. Example: Nepal Biratnagar NPR.<br>• <strong>Country</strong> — Automatically populated based on cost centre. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Country attribute</strong><br>• The country attribute auto-populates from the cost centre and shows where the transaction was generated — useful for intra-country/centre transactions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>Reference manuals</strong><br>• For instructions on using attributes in Agresso transaction entry, refer to the Introduction to Agresso FMS and General Ledger Manual on OneNet — section 'Registering / Posting a standard journal to the General Ledger'. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — General Accounting &amp; Coding Structure"> <strong>2.2.4 Reporting attributes (indirect dimensions)</strong><br>• Reporting attributes are used only for reporting and are linked to posting attributes.

The purpose of this chapter is to set out mandatory controls and minimum standards for awarding, managing, monitoring and closing sub-awards so that: funds are used for authorised purposes; donor and statutory requirements are met; partner capacity is assessed and supported; programmatic and financial performance are evidenced and reconciled; financial risk (including fraud) is mitigated; and both SCI and donors have auditable documentation for all partner relationships. No transfer of resources may take place without a signed sub-award agreement and appropriate pre-award approvals. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Scope</strong><br>This chapter applies to all SCI country offices, sub-offices and any SCI unit that manages awards that involve transfers of resources to third-party organisations. It covers: partner selection and due diligence, pre-award capacity assessment, the sub-award agreement and amendments, financial and programmatic monitoring, accounting and GL treatment, audit and assurance requirements, partner capacity-building, mitigation of financial and reputational risk, close-out procedures and records retention. It excludes standard vendor procurement for goods and services where suppliers are paid through Accounts Payable under procurement policy (unless the contract is structured as a sub-award). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Key definitions & core recognition principle</strong><br>• <strong>Sub-award / sub-grant / partner award / sub-awardee:</strong> an agreement between SCI and an external organisation in which SCI transfers resources (cash or in-kind) for the partner to implement activities or provide services that advance SCI objectives. The partner remains an external legal entity and acts under an agreed scope of work and budget.<br>• <strong>Pre-award assessment / capacity assessment:</strong> financial systems and fiscal management review performed by Finance (with inputs from Programme, Legal or others) to assess partner ability to manage funds and comply with donor and SCI rules prior to award. <br>• <strong>Sub-award agreement:</strong> a signed document (contract) containing terms & conditions, budget, payment schedule, reporting requirements, audit obligations, liability clauses and termination/close-out provisions. No payments without a signed agreement. <br>• <strong>Sub-award amendment:</strong> an authorised, signed change to the sub-award agreement (scope, budget, duration, payment terms) agreed between SCI and the partner. <br>• <strong>Advance:</strong> cash paid upfront to a partner (recorded to Partners payments – advances 5200) that must be supported by a subsequent financial report and/or reconciliation. <br>• <strong>Core principle:</strong> ensure full documentary evidence, pre-award checks and risk-based monitoring are in place before funds transfer; align programmatic and financial reporting; retain audit trail to enable donor and statutory scrutiny. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Core principles / Key principles</strong><br>1. No transfer of funds or in-kind assistance without a signed sub-award agreement. <br>2. Conduct an evidence-based pre-award financial and capacity assessment for every partner prior to award. <br>3. Use a risk-based approach for monitoring frequency and depth; higher value or higher-risk partners require more frequent and deeper monitoring. <br>4. Maintain segregation of duties — partner selection, technical oversight, financial approval and payment execution must involve distinct roles. <br>5. Ensure programmatic deliverables and financial reports reconcile and that programme staff sign off on programmatic acceptability before finance authorises final payments. <br>6. Keep full documentary support (signed agreement/amendments, capacity assessment, financial reports, bank reconciliations, monitoring visit reports, audit reports) in partner file. <br>7. Implement partner capacity strengthening where gaps are identified; monitor delivery of capacity-building plans. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Governance & responsibilities (RACI)</strong><br><strong>Country Director (CD):</strong> accountable for overall partnership strategy and oversight of sub-award procedures; approves and signs (where in DoA) partner monitoring visit plan; approves high-risk partner engagements and material amendments.<br><strong>Country Finance Director (CFD):</strong> owner of financial controls for sub-awards; responsible for pre-award financial capacity assessments, ensuring payments only occur against signed agreements and approved reports, oversight of financial monitoring, implementation of partner capacity building plans, ensuring accurate accounting and reconciliation, and closing sub-awards only after all conditions met.<br><strong>Programme Manager / Project Manager:</strong> responsible for partner selection inputs, programmatic due diligence, ensuring programmatic monitoring is carried out, certifying that programmatic deliverables have been met and that programmatic and financial reports are consistent.<br><strong>Procurement / Legal:</strong> provide inputs to partner vetting (where relevant), review contract terms and ensure compliance with donor and organisational procurement rules.<br><strong>Payments Officer / Treasury:</strong> executes payments only after receipt of payment authorisation and evidence of signed agreement; maintains bank advices and ensures maker-checker controls on payment execution.<br><strong>Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) / Partnership Manager:</strong> supports programmatic monitoring, contributes to partner capacity assessments and ensures learning and reporting requirements are met.<br><strong>Partner / Sub-awardee:</strong> responsible for implementing activities, maintaining financial records, producing timely programmatic and financial reports, cooperating with monitoring and audit, and returning unused funds or interest as per agreement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Systems & security / Reference to systems</strong><br>• Use the approved contract template and sub-award agreement stored on OneNet. <br>• Financial transactions for partner payments and advances must be recorded in Agresso (or approved GL system) following the ‘Payments to Partners’ procedure (see Introduction to Agresso FMS and General Ledger Manual — section ‘Payments to Partners’ on OneNet). <br>• Maintain partner files in a secure, access-controlled repository (electronic or physical) with version control for agreements, amendments, capacity assessments, monitoring reports and audit documents. <br>• Ensure sensitive partner financial data is treated as confidential and protected according to data protection policies — encrypt files in transit and at rest, limit access to authorised staff only. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Partner selection & pre-award requirements</strong><br>Before any sub-award is issued, the following must be completed and evidenced in the partner file: <br>1. <strong>Needs & fit assessment:</strong> programme team documents rationale for partnering, scope of work, expected deliverables, budget estimate and alignment with SCI objectives. <br>2. <strong>Partner due diligence:</strong> verify partner legal status, governance structure, registration, tax status, past performance, and reputation checks (incl. adverse media where appropriate). <br>3. <strong>Financial systems & fiscal management capacity assessment (pre-award assessment):</strong> finance conducts a documented review of partner accounting systems, internal controls, financial reporting capacity, bank arrangements, segregation of duties, procurement and asset management processes, historical audits and any prior donor-funded experience. Record findings, risk rating and recommended mitigation actions or capacity-strengthening measures. <br>4. <strong>Risk assessment & mitigation:</strong> use a standard risk matrix that evaluates award value, fiduciary risk, partner history, geography/security context and donor requirements. Establish monitoring intensity, reporting frequency and any special clauses (e.g., restrictive use of advances, escrow, retention). <br>5. <strong>Approval:</strong> award is approved per Delegation of Authority (DoA) and documented.

If a partner’s bank is not acceptable, SCI should advise the partner to move funds to an acceptable bank or propose alternative payment mechanisms. <br>• Payment method (bank transfer, mobile money, cash) must be agreed in the sub-award. Cash is discouraged and only permitted under exceptional circumstances with strict controls documented in the agreement and supported by the monitoring plan. <br>• For bank transfers, ensure partner bank details are verified and changes to bank accounts require written, authorised confirmation and additional verification steps (e.g., independent confirmation call to known signatory). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 3 — Sub-awards to partners"> <strong>Sub-award agreement & amendments</strong><br>• All sub-awards require a signed sub-award agreement using the approved SCI template.

Fundraising income represents a high reputational, compliance and fraud-risk area because it involves public trust, donor intent, regulatory scrutiny and third-party handling. The objectives are to:<br>1. Ensure all funds are raised ethically, transparently and lawfully.<br>2. Ensure funds are applied strictly in accordance with donor intent, member agreements, SCI policies and local law.<br>3. Maintain full traceability from solicitation through receipt, banking, accounting, transfer and final use.<br>4. Protect donor confidence, organisational reputation and brand integrity.<br>5. Prevent loss, misappropriation, fraud, money laundering, sanctions breaches or misuse.<br>6. Support accurate, timely reporting to donors, members, regulators, auditors and SCI centre. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 7 — Fundraising and Locally Received Funds"> <strong>Scope (comprehensive)</strong><br>This chapter applies to all locally raised income handled by country offices, sub-offices, field offices, prospect members and any entity acting on behalf of SCI, regardless of size, channel, currency or form.

Review trends and escalate adverse movements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 7 — Fundraising and Locally Received Funds"> <strong>Segregation of duties & compensating controls</strong><br>Fundraising staff must not bank, post or reconcile income. Finance performs independent reconciliations. Where segregation is limited, compensating controls (two-person handling, senior review, surprise counts) are mandatory. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 7 — Fundraising and Locally Received Funds"> <strong>Fraud prevention, AML & sanctions</strong><br>Apply risk-based AML checks to large or unusual donations.

Attach distribution pack, valuation sheet and translation worksheet. System will translate to functional currency at posting date; record FX effect and map to FX GLs where required. Ensure postings are traceable to physical distribution evidence. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Capital items & fixed assets donated as GiK</strong><br>Capital GiK (vehicles, generators, furniture, ICT equipment) that meet capitalization thresholds must be recognised as donated non-monetary assets on the date control transfers for productive use (this may be distribution or earlier if control is transferred and donor terms require). Accounting entries for capital GiK on recognition: Dr Fixed Asset (at fair/valuation) / Cr Income — GiK (capital). Capitalise at donor valuation or fair market value; record depreciation policy, useful life and residual value; tag physical assets and assign custodian. For assets transferred to partners, treat per local rules: capital recognition only when SCI assumes control/use or when award requires. Document asset maintenance plans and insurance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Numeric examples</strong><br>1) Consumable distribution: donor supplies 1,000 food kits valued EUR 10 each = EUR 10,000.

System converts to functional currency at posting date; disclose translation impact if material.<br>2) Capital gift: donor donates 1 vehicle valued USD 15,000 for country office use. On acceptance into use (control transfer): Dr Fixed Asset — Vehicles USD 15,000 / Cr 3305 GiK Capital Income USD 15,000; set depreciation per policy. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Detailed distribution process — step-by-step</strong><br>1. Programme finalises beneficiary list, distribution plan and frequency; assign award and SOF/DEA mappings.<br>2. Prepare authorised partner distribution form/agreement and obtain partner/beneficiary acknowledgements where applicable.<br>3. Update GiK schedule to <em>Ready for distribution</em> with batch ref and distribution plan.<br>4. Budget holder confirms valuation and obtains CFD sign-off for donor-currency posting (documented).<br>5. Prepare posting pack (waybills, valuation, approvals, recommended donor-currency journals, SOF/DEA and monitoring evidence).<br>6. Finance prepares donor-currency journal referencing GiK schedule ID; checks attachments and translation worksheet.<br>7. Budget holder authorises journal (signature or electronic approval).<br>8. Finance posts in Agresso/ERP; checks for system translation and errors; record posting reference in GiK schedule.<br>9. File posted journal, distribution evidence and monitoring reports; update GiK schedule and movement history.<br>10. Conduct post-distribution verification (sample beneficiary confirmation, photos) and record results. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Quarterly stock & reconciliation procedures</strong><br>Frequency: minimum quarterly plus spot checks and risk-based cycle counts (monthly for high-value/pharmaceuticals).<br>Steps: logistics performs physical count → GiK Coordinator compiles count worksheet → finance reconciles GiK schedule, logistics stock report and GL by donor/award/SOF → any variances investigated and evidenced → reconciliation signed off by Logistics, GiK Coordinator, Finance and CD → unresolved material variances escalated to Regional Finance. Reconciliation columns: item, batch, opening qty, receipts, distributions, adjustments, closing qty, unit valuation (donor currency), closing value, GL balance, variance & explanation, supporting doc IDs. Maintain ageing of receipts and distributions and expiry alerts. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Losses, shortages, write-offs & incident handling</strong><br>Losses before distribution (damage, theft, spoilage) reduce physical stock and require incident documentation and authorisation per thresholds. Procedure: immediate incident report (photos, witness statements, CCTV where available), isolate evidence, calculate donor-currency quantum, determine cause, obtain approvals per DoA for write-off, notify donor and insurer where required, and record accounting adjustment only after approval. For post-distribution losses (partner misappropriation), conduct investigation, consider accounting reversals or recovery actions, update partner controls and pursue legal/insurance claims. Maintain loss register and trend analysis. Do <strong>not</strong> record accounting revenue/expense for lost stock prior to authorised distribution accounting except where donor/award rules require different treatment and documented approval exists. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Controls to minimise losses & fraud</strong><br>Secure warehouse access controls, CCTV, temperature monitoring, tamper-evident seals, segregation of duties (receipt, stock update, distribution authorisation, GL posting), surprise counts, rotation of custodians, dual custody for high-value items, authorised sign-off for all movements, independent reconciliation and access logs. Implement beneficiary verification sampling and partner spot checks. Use analytics to detect anomalous distribution patterns (e.g., repeated round quantities, rapid depletion). Maintain whistleblower channels and clear escalation protocols. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Partner distributions & monitoring</strong><br>Include GiK-specific clauses in partner contracts: stock custody, segregation, reporting cadence, retention of beneficiary receipts, right to audit, insurance and indemnities. Require partners to maintain separate ledgers for donor GiK and provide monthly movement reports and signed distribution confirmations. Implement risk-based monitoring (on-site visits, sample beneficiary verification, reconciliation to GL) and hold back a retention percentage or require financial guarantees for high-value flows where appropriate. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Disposal, sale, exchange & substitution of GiK</strong><br>Where GiK cannot be used as intended (damaged, obsolete, unsuitable), assess options (repair, re-allocate, sell, donate to alternate eligible beneficiary, return to donor). Sales/proceeds from disposal are treated per donor terms: proceeds may be recorded as restricted income (donor-specific) or returned to donor; obtain donor approval where required. Document disposal decision, valuation of proceeds, approvals per DoA and accounting treatment. For substitutions where GiK replaces planned cash purchases, disclose avoided cash cost per donor rules and ensure donor consent for substitution where required. Maintain detailed disposal file and reconciliation of proceeds. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Tax, customs, duty & procurement integration</strong><br>Record duties, VAT and clearance costs as separate operating expenses; secure duty exemption documentation where available. Ensure procurement integration for handling contracts, warehousing, transport and customs brokers. When GiK displaces planned purchases, consider donor restrictions on cost savings and record avoided cost treatment per donor policy. Ensure correct VAT treatment and seek tax/legal advice for non-routine cases (e.g., cross-border donations of capital goods). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Systems, templates & KPIs</strong><br>Maintain GiK schedule in a controlled spreadsheet or integrated ERP/WMS module linked to Agresso/GLACOS. Required templates: GiK schedule, receipt/warehouse record, distribution authorisation, partner distribution agreement, valuation certificate, stock count checklist, reconciliation pack, loss incident report, cold-chain log, disposal authorisation. Suggested KPIs: total GiK received by donor/type; % GiK distributed within SLA; stock days on hand; number/value of losses; % reconciled monthly; time from receipt to distribution; % of item batches expiring within X days; top donors by value; partner distribution accuracy rate. Monitor KPIs monthly and escalate adverse trends. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Common errors, control mitigations & automated checks</strong><br>Common mistakes: posting at receipt; posting in local currency instead of donor currency; missing valuation support; incorrect SOF/DEA mapping; not updating GiK schedule; lack of batch/expiry tracking; filing gaps; partner-led misreporting. Mitigations: enforce recognise-on-distribution rule via system controls, mandatory attachment of valuation evidence, GL validation rules preventing donor-currency bypass, mandatory reconciliations, expiry alerts, access controls, role separation and targeted training. Implement automation where feasible: electronic receiving, barcode scanning, WMS-ERP integration and automatic generation of distribution packs. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Audit expectations & audit pack</strong><br>Auditors will expect chain-of-custody evidence, valuation support, documentation that journals are only posted on distribution (or approved exception), reconciliations between logistics and finance, approval trails for write-offs, sample distribution confirmations and partner audit rights.

Ensure GiK schedule reconciles to Agresso donor reporting and member consolidation packs. Provide donor narrative that explains valuation method, any translation effects and disposal proceeds. Flag material variances early and propose corrective actions. Maintain clear mapping between GiK income codes and donor award fields for consolidation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Monitoring, evaluation & beneficiary accountability</strong><br>Conduct post-distribution monitoring (PDM) and sample beneficiary verification to confirm receipt and appropriateness. Maintain beneficiary lists and signatures or digital confirmations where feasible. Capture feedback and complaint handling records. Use monitoring evidence to validate accounting postings and to inform programme adaptations. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Record retention, naming conventions & file structure</strong><br>Required docs per shipment/distribution: donor packing list/valuation, waybills/B/L, customs docs, warehouse receipt, GiK schedule line sheet, valuation support, authorised distribution form, beneficiary receipts, posted finance journal, reconciliation worksheet, photos, incident reports and disposal docs. <strong>File naming convention:</strong> <code>GiK_&lt;Donor&gt;_&lt;AwardID&gt;_&lt;ItemCode&gt;_&lt;DistDate YYYYMMDD&gt;_&lt;BatchID&gt;_&lt;DocType&gt;.pdf</code> (example: <code>GiK_ECHO_AW1234_FOODKIT_20251210_BAT02_DistributionPack.pdf</code>). Retain per SCI/donor retention policy (commonly 6–10 years or longer if local law/donor requires). Maintain a centralized index/master register with hyperlinks to documents. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Training, capacity building & continuous improvement</strong><br>Provide role-specific training for logistics, programme, finance and partner staff covering recognition policy, valuation methods, cold-chain, stock counting, WMS use, donor reporting and fraud indicators. Run tabletop exercises and post-incident reviews. Review SOPs after pilot and major shipments; incorporate audit findings. Maintain a lessons-learned log and update templates/KPI targets periodically. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Systems & automation opportunities</strong><br>Integrate WMS with Agresso/ERP to auto-post movements to GiK schedule, implement barcode/RFID scanning to reduce manual errors, enable electronic distribution confirmation via mobile apps for remote distributions, configure GL validation rules to block donor-currency bypass, and use dashboards for KPIs and expiry alerts. Document and control any automation changes and retain human review where material judgements exist. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Cross-references & related policies</strong><br>Refer to: Treasury/bank controls (banking of proceeds from sales), Fixed assets policy (capital GiK), Procurement policy (handling contracts), Partner management policy, Fraud & whistleblower policy, Insurance policy, Customs & import guidance, Award management and donor compliance manuals. Where donor rules differ, donor terms take precedence — deviations require written approval and documented rationale. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 8 — Gifts in Kind (GiK)"> <strong>Final compliance & limitations note</strong><br>Local thresholds, valuation approaches, insurance limits and escalation routes must align with SCI central policy, donor agreements, local law and Scheme of Delegation. Maintain a full, auditable trail for each material GiK transaction. Where donor rules require alternative treatment (e.g., recognise at receipt), obtain documented approval from CFD/CD and record the rationale. Ensure transparency in reporting and correct mapping of donor currencies and SOF/DEA for consolidation. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 37</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table9" data-table="Docu_0152_09" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Table 9</strong></div>

Expect auditors to test signature compliance, reconcile GL to bank, review stale items and test segregation of duties. Respond to audit queries promptly and retain evidence of corrective actions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Reconciliation KPIs, reporting & monitoring to management</strong><br>Key metrics: days to complete reconciliation (target e.g., ≤7 working days after month-end), % reconciling items >30 days, number/value of suspense items, bank fees variance, time to clear stale cheques. Provide CD/CFD monthly summary of bank positions, aged reconciling items, significant fees and unauthorised transactions. Produce cash forecasts for treasury planning and escalate urgent incidents. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Fraud detection, incident response & escalation</strong><br>Monitor unusual patterns (frequent small reconciling items, vendor changes, related-party payments). Maintain whistleblower reporting and incident escalation. On suspected fraud: freeze accounts where possible, preserve evidence, notify CD/CFD/Regional/internal audit and bank, cooperate with investigations and legal counsel, implement remediation and control strengthening. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Handling stale cheques & stale deposits</strong><br>Identify stale cheques per local law (e.g., >6 months) and follow stop payment/write-back policy with authorisation. Stale deposits must be reconciled and owner traced; post to suspense only with CFD authorisation and resolution plan. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Interest, bank service levels & fee monitoring</strong><br>Reconcile interest earned and bank fee schedules monthly; review bank fee invoices for accuracy and renegotiate fees where necessary. Track SLAs and bank performance (timeliness, statement availability, error resolution). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Document retention & archival</strong><br>Retain bank files, statements and reconciliations per retention policy (recommended minimum 7 years or longer if local law/donor requires). Archive closed account files with clear index and access controls. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Templates, checklists & where to find them</strong><br>Maintain templates for: bank account opening/closing request, monthly bank reconciliation, bank file index, payment instruction form, bank signatory change request, vendor bank verification checklist, suspense posting authorisation, and bank reconciliation-to-GL template. Store centrally in country finance shared drive/document repository. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Sample checklists & bank reconciliation checklist (monthly)</strong><br>☐ Obtain month-end statement and download bank transactions.<br>☐ Extract GL bank ledger to same date.<br>☐ Match transactions and mark reconciled items.<br>☐ Identify outstanding deposits and cheques and age them.<br>☐ Verify bank charges, interest and FX entries and post journals as necessary.<br>☐ Investigate mismatches and attach evidence.<br>☐ Sign-off by preparer and independent reviewer.<br>☐ File reconciliation and statement in bank file. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Sample journal narrative & filename examples</strong><br>Journal narrative example: “Bank charges Oct 2025 — Bank: BCA IDR 1234 — GL 6002 Bank Fees — Statement Ref: BCA_STMT_20251031 — Posted 2025-11-02.”<br>Archive filename examples: BankRec_BCA_ID_1234_20251031.pdf ; BankFile_BCA_Indonesia_1234_IDR.pdf </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Key performance controls checklist (monthly)</strong><br>1. All bank accounts reconciled and signed by preparer & reviewer.<br>2. Reconciling items >30 days documented with action owners.<br>3. Bank file updated with latest mandates & statements.<br>4. Dual signatory compliance verified on sample payments.<br>5. Vendor bank change log reviewed and validated.<br>6. Suspense ledger reviewed and cleared or escalated.<br>7. Treasury/centre notified of unusual balances or issues. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Common errors, pitfalls & remedial actions</strong><br>Common mistakes: missing bank mandate in file; reconciliations not performed monthly; preparer is signatory; aged reconciling items not investigated; payments without adequate authorisation; weak vendor bank-change controls; e-banking compromise. Remediations: enforce reconciliation calendar, require preparer/reviewer signatures, checklist-based file reviews, mandatory vendor verification, MFA/tokens and access reviews, automation (bank feeds) and internal audit spot checks. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Training, awareness & continuous improvement</strong><br>Regular training for finance, treasury and cash handling staff on bank controls, e-banking security, payment fraud patterns, AML obligations and verification protocols. Conduct refresher training after policy or system changes. Periodically review banking policy, signatory thresholds, reconciliation templates and automation opportunities (positive pay, bank feeds). Conduct post-incident reviews and implement corrective actions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Integration with cash forecasting & treasury</strong><br>Coordinate cash forecasting with treasury/centre for liquidity management, currency conversion timing and minimising idle balances. Use forecasts to plan transfers, conversions and overdraft/credit facility usage. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Special topics — remote/field/sub-office banking</strong><br>Sub-office accounts require strict controls: limited signatories, daily deposit rules, imprest limits, pre-approved transfer thresholds, mandatory monthly reconciliation submission to country office and periodic on-site spot checks. Prefer centralised banking where possible to reduce risk. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Technology & automation opportunities</strong><br>Adopt bank feeds/connectors to auto-import statements into Agresso/GLACOS, implement reconciliation automation, use secure APIs for payment submission and integrate with AR/AP systems to reduce manual posting errors. Maintain controls over automation and document changes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 10 — Bank Accounts and Banking Controls"> <strong>Final compliance & implementation note</strong><br>Align signatory limits, SLA timelines, account naming, AML measures and bank selection decisions with central treasury policy, donor rules and applicable local law before implementation. Document any local deviations with rationale and obtain approvals. Maintain a full, auditable trail for each account and material transaction. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 49</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
