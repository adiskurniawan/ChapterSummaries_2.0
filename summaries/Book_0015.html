purpose of accounting rules and principles under Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (PSAK) is to ensure that financial statements provide information that is relevant, reliable, comparable, and understandable for users such as investors, creditors, regulators, management, and other stakeholders.<br>Accounting standards aim to faithfully represent an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows, support economic decision-making, ensure accountability for resources entrusted to management, and enable consistency across entities and reporting periods.<br>PSAK is largely converged with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), supporting international comparability while reflecting Indonesian legal, economic, and regulatory conditions.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Scope & applicability of PSAK</strong><br>PSAK applies primarily to profit-oriented entities preparing general-purpose financial statements intended for external users.<br>The standards are issued by the Indonesian Accounting Standards Board (DSAK-IAI) and are mandatory for entities within scope, subject to effective dates and transition provisions.<br>Entities outside PSAK scope (e.g., micro, small, or shariah entities) may apply alternative frameworks such as SAK EMKM or Sharia Accounting Standards, but PSAK remains the dominant framework for large and listed entities.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Conceptual Framework (foundation of PSAK)</strong><br>The Conceptual Framework underpins all PSAK standards and guides standard-setting, interpretation, and application where no specific PSAK applies.<br>It defines the objective of financial reporting, qualitative characteristics of useful financial information (relevance and faithful representation, supported by comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability), and the elements of financial statements (assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses).<br>It also establishes recognition criteria, measurement bases (historical cost, current value, fair value, value in use), and concepts of capital and capital maintenance.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Underlying accounting assumptions</strong><br>Financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis unless management intends or is required to liquidate the entity or cease trading.<br>The accrual basis of accounting is applied, meaning transactions and events are recognised when they occur, not when cash is received or paid, except for cash flow information.<br>Consistency of presentation and classification is required from period to period unless a change results in more reliable and relevant information or is required by a PSAK.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Presentation of financial statements – PSAK 1</strong><br>PSAK 1 prescribes the overall requirements for the presentation of financial statements, including structure, minimum content, and general features.<br>A complete set of financial statements includes: statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows, and notes comprising significant accounting policies and explanatory information.<br>Entities must present comparative information for prior periods and disclose judgements, estimates, and sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of material adjustment.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations – PSAK 58</strong><br>PSAK 58 applies to non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale and to discontinued operations.<br>An asset is classified as held for sale when its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and the sale is highly probable.<br>Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, are presented separately on the statement of financial position, and are not depreciated.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Accounting policies, estimates and errors – PSAK 25</strong><br>PSAK 25 governs the selection and application of accounting policies, accounting for changes in estimates, and correction of errors.<br>Accounting policies are applied consistently unless a change is required by a PSAK or results in more reliable and relevant information.<br>Changes in accounting estimates are recognised prospectively, while material prior-period errors require retrospective restatement of comparative information unless impracticable.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Interpretations related to accounting policies – ISAK 32</strong><br>ISAK 32 provides interpretative guidance for specific applications of PSAK 25 where judgement is required.<br>It assists entities in distinguishing between changes in accounting policies and changes in estimates and in applying retrospective or prospective treatment appropriately.<br>This interpretation enhances consistency and comparability across entities applying PSAK 25.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Measurement bases and fair value – PSAK 68</strong><br>PSAK 68 establishes a single framework for fair value measurement and related disclosures across all PSAK standards that require or permit fair value.<br>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.<br>The standard introduces a fair value hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) based on the observability of inputs and requires extensive disclosures, particularly for Level 3 measurements.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Financial instruments – overall framework</strong><br>Financial instruments accounting under PSAK encompasses classification, measurement, impairment, hedge accounting, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities.<br>The framework aims to reflect an entity’s business model for managing financial instruments and the characteristics of contractual cash flows.<br>Relevant standards include PSAK 50 (presentation), PSAK 55 (recognition and measurement, largely superseded), PSAK 60 (disclosures), and PSAK 71 (current comprehensive standard).<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Financial instruments – PSAK 71 (classification and measurement)</strong><br>PSAK 71 classifies financial assets based on the entity’s business model and whether contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).<br>Financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).<br>Financial liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost, except for certain liabilities measured at fair value, with presentation rules aligned to economic substance.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Financial instruments – impairment (expected credit loss model)</strong><br>PSAK 71 introduces a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) model, replacing the incurred loss model.<br>ECLs are recognised on initial recognition and updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk.<br>The model distinguishes between 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, requiring more timely recognition of credit losses and enhanced credit risk disclosures.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Financial instruments – hedge accounting and disclosures – PSAK 60</strong><br>Hedge accounting under PSAK 71 aligns accounting treatment with risk management activities and allows greater flexibility compared to previous standards.<br>PSAK 60 requires extensive qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the significance of financial instruments, risks arising from them, and how those risks are managed.<br>Disclosures include credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and sensitivity analyses.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Foreign currency transactions – PSAK 10</strong><br>PSAK 10 governs accounting for foreign currency transactions and foreign operations.<br>Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded using the spot exchange rate at the transaction date; monetary items are retranslated at the closing rate at each reporting date.<br>Exchange differences are generally recognised in profit or loss, except for certain items recognised in other comprehensive income.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Hyperinflationary economies – PSAK 63</strong><br>PSAK 63 applies when an entity’s functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy.<br>Financial statements are restated to reflect changes in purchasing power using a general price index before being translated into another currency.<br>The objective is to ensure that financial information remains meaningful and comparable in conditions of extreme inflation.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Revenue recognition – PSAK 72</strong><br>PSAK 72 establishes a comprehensive five-step model for recognising revenue from contracts with customers.<br>Revenue is recognised when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, either over time or at a point in time.<br>The standard requires identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of transaction price, and recognition of revenue based on satisfaction of obligations, with extensive disclosure requirements.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Government grants – PSAK 61</strong><br>PSAK 61 addresses accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance.<br>Grants are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that conditions will be met and the grants will be received.<br>Grants related to assets are presented either as deferred income or deducted from the carrying amount of the asset, while income-related grants are recognised systematically in profit or loss.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Operating segments – PSAK 5</strong><br>PSAK 5 requires entities to disclose information about operating segments based on internal reports reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM).<br>Segment reporting reflects management’s view of the business, enhancing relevance for users assessing performance and resource allocation.<br>Disclosures include segment revenue, profit or loss, assets, liabilities (if reviewed), and reconciliations to entity-wide totals.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Employee benefits – PSAK 24</strong><br>PSAK 24 governs accounting for employee benefits, including short-term benefits, post-employment benefits, other long-term benefits, and termination benefits.<br>Defined contribution plans recognise expense as contributions are due, while defined benefit plans require actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.<br>Remeasurements of defined benefit obligations are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Share-based payment – PSAK 53</strong><br>PSAK 53 requires entities to recognise the fair value of goods or services received in share-based payment transactions.<br>Equity-settled transactions are measured at grant-date fair value and recognised over the vesting period, while cash-settled transactions are remeasured at each reporting date.<br>The standard ensures that compensation cost is reflected in financial performance, even when no cash outflow occurs.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Income taxes – PSAK 46</strong><br>PSAK 46 prescribes accounting for current and deferred income taxes using the balance sheet approach.<br>Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.<br>Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Earnings per share – PSAK 56</strong><br>PSAK 56 sets principles for calculating and presenting basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS).<br>Basic EPS is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.<br>Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution from convertible instruments, options, and other potential ordinary shares.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Disclosure, transparency and comparability</strong><br>PSAK emphasises comprehensive disclosure to enable users to understand the financial statements and assess an entity’s financial position and performance.<br>Disclosures include significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates, risk exposures, and sensitivity analyses where required.<br>Consistency, clarity, and comparability across periods and entities are fundamental principles reinforced throughout PSAK standards.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accounting Rules and Principles (PSAK-based)"> <strong>Governance, judgement and compliance</strong><br>Management is responsible for selecting appropriate accounting policies, making judgements and estimates, and ensuring compliance with PSAK.<br>Those charged with governance oversee the financial reporting process, internal controls, and compliance with applicable standards.<br>Non-compliance with PSAK may result in qualified audit opinions, regulatory sanctions, or reduced credibility of financial information.<br>

The notes explain accounting policies, judgments, estimates, risks and detailed line-item breakdowns necessary for transparency, auditability, regulatory compliance and informed economic decision-making. The balance sheet is prepared on a going concern basis and under accrual accounting unless PSAK permits otherwise.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Scope & structure of balance sheet and notes</strong>.<br>The balance sheet covers all recognised assets, liabilities and equity at period end; related notes include accounting policies, supporting schedules, reconciliations, commitments, contingencies and post-reporting disclosures. Presentation follows PSAK 1 and is supported by specific standards (PSAK 19, 16, 13, 48, 73, 14, 57, 8 and related ISAKs). Comparative information for the prior period is required unless an exemption applies.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Core recognition & measurement principles</strong>.<br>Assets are recognised when future economic benefits are probable and measurable reliably; liabilities are recognised when a present obligation exists and settlement is probable and measurable. Initial measurement is at cost unless a PSAK requires fair value or another basis. Subsequent measurement depends on the applicable standard (cost, amortised cost, revaluation, fair value). Materiality and substance over form guide recognition, classification and disclosure decisions.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Classification & presentation rules</strong>.<br>Classify assets and liabilities as current or non-current based on operating cycle and expected realisation/settlement within 12 months unless liquidity presentation is more relevant. Present minimum line items on the face of the statement with further disaggregation in notes. Offsetting is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by a PSAK.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Judgements, estimates & uncertainty</strong>.<br>Disclose significant judgements (e.g., lease classification, functional currency, CGU identification) and key sources of estimation uncertainty (e.g., impairment assumptions, useful lives, provisions). Provide sensitivity disclosures where estimation uncertainty could lead to material future adjustments.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Key definitions & core recognition principle</strong>.<br>• <strong>Carrying amount:</strong> asset amount after accumulated amortisation/depreciation and impairment.<br>• <strong>Recoverable amount:</strong> higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use (PSAK 48).<br>• <strong>Right-of-use asset:</strong> lessee’s asset representing use-right under PSAK 73.<br>• <strong>Investment property:</strong> property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation (PSAK 13).<br>• <strong>Provision:</strong> present obligation from past events with probable outflow (PSAK 57).<br><strong>Core principle:</strong> recognise items only when respective PSAK recognition criteria are met and measure using the model required by that PSAK.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Intangible assets — recognition & measurement (PSAK 19)</strong>.<br>Intangibles are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance (separable or contractual/legal rights). Recognise separately acquired intangibles at cost. Internally generated intangibles: research expensed; development capitalised only if technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use/sell, probable future benefits, resource availability and reliable measurement are all demonstrated. Subsequent measurement: cost or revaluation model (active market required). Finite-lived intangibles are amortised; indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortised and are tested annually for impairment.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Intangible assets — disclosures</strong>.<br>Disclose useful lives, amortisation methods, gross carrying amounts, accumulated amortisation and impairment, reconciliation of movements, amounts capitalised for development costs and the basis for recognition, and the line items in profit or loss where amortisation is included.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Property, plant & equipment — recognition & initial measurement (PSAK 16)</strong>.<br>PPE are tangible assets held for use in production, supply, rental or administrative purposes and expected to be used for more than one period. Initial cost includes purchase price, directly attributable costs and initial estimates of dismantling/restoration obligations. Capitalise borrowing costs per PSAK 26 where applicable. Commence depreciation when the asset is available for use.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>PPE — subsequent measurement, componentisation & derecognition</strong>.<br>Choose cost model (cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment) or revaluation model applied consistently to entire classes. Component accounting: split parts with materially different useful lives and depreciate separately. Capitalise subsequent expenditure only if it enhances future benefits; routine maintenance is expensed. Derecognise on disposal or when no future benefits expected; recognise gain/loss in profit or loss.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>PPE — disclosures</strong>.<br>Disclose measurement bases, depreciation methods and rates, reconciliation of carrying amounts (additions, disposals, revaluations, depreciation, impairment), restrictions on title, pledged assets, capital commitments and revaluation surplus movements (if any).<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Investment property — recognition & measurement (PSAK 13)</strong>.<br>Investment property is land or buildings held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation. Initial measurement at cost. Subsequent measurement: either fair value model (changes to profit or loss) or cost model (depreciation + impairment, with fair value disclosed). Transfers to/from investment property require evidence of change in use, not merely management intention.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Investment property — disclosures</strong>.<br>Disclose chosen measurement model, fair value determination methods, rental income, direct operating expenses, restrictions on realisability and contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment property.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Impairment of assets — overview & triggers (PSAK 48)</strong>.<br>Assess at each reporting date whether indicators of impairment exist. If present, estimate recoverable amount (higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use). Impair when carrying amount exceeds recoverable amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles: annual testing regardless of indicators. Perform CGU-level testing where cash inflows are not independent.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Impairment — recognition, reversal & disclosures</strong>.<br>Recognise impairment losses in profit or loss; allocate first to goodwill then to other assets of the CGU pro rata. Reversals are permitted for assets other than goodwill when estimates change. Disclose impairment losses and reversals, key assumptions (discount rate, growth rates), and sensitivity analyses for material CGUs.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Lease accounting — recognition & measurement (PSAK 73)</strong>.<br>Lessees recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement date for most leases. Lease liability measured at present value of lease payments; ROU asset measured at cost (including initial direct costs) and depreciated. Exemptions for short-term leases and low-value assets may be elected. Lessors classify leases as finance or operating and account accordingly.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Leases — presentation & disclosures</strong>.<br>Disclose maturity analysis of lease liabilities, variable lease payments, extension/termination options and expense related to exempt leases. Present ROU assets separately or within the same line item as underlying assets with reconciliation of movements.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Inventories — recognition & measurement (PSAK 14)</strong>.<br>Inventories are assets held for sale, in production, or to be consumed in production. Measure at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). Cost includes purchase, conversion and other costs incurred to bring inventories to present condition and location. Permitted cost formulas: FIFO or weighted average; LIFO prohibited.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Inventories — write-downs & disclosures</strong>.<br>Write down inventories to NRV when damaged, obsolete or when selling prices decline; reverse write-downs if circumstances improve. Disclose accounting policies, carrying amounts by category, amount recognised as expense (cost of sales), write-downs and reversals, and inventories pledged as security.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Provisions & contingencies — recognition & measurement (PSAK 57)</strong>.<br>Recognise a provision when a present legal or constructive obligation from a past event exists, an outflow is probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. Measure at the best estimate of expenditure required, discounted when the time value of money is material. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed unless remote; contingent assets disclosed when inflow probable.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Provisions — specific applications & disclosures</strong>.<br>Special guidance for restructuring provisions, onerous contracts, warranties and reimbursements. Disclose nature, timing, uncertainties, movement during the period and expected reimbursements. For reimbursements, recognise asset only when reimbursement virtually certain and not exceeding the related provision.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Events after the reporting period — PSAK 8</strong>.<br>Classify post-reporting events as adjusting (evidence of conditions existing at reporting date — adjust recognised amounts) or non-adjusting (arising after reporting date — disclose if material). Disclose date of authorisation for issue, proposed dividends, significant non-adjusting events and material post-period commitments.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Share capital & reserves — recognition & presentation</strong>.<br>Share capital recorded at proceeds received net of transaction costs; equity instruments not remeasured after initial recognition. Reserves include retained earnings, revaluation surplus, translation reserve, hedging reserve and other OCI components. Disclose authorised, issued and paid shares, par value, rights/restrictions, treasury shares and reconciliation of movements in the statement of changes in equity; present non-controlling interests separately within equity.<br> </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Balance Sheet and Related Notes (PSAK)"> <strong>Related notes — general disclosure requirements</strong>.<br>Notes must clearly present accounting policies, significant judgments and estimates, and detailed supporting information for balance sheet line items with cross-references to primary statements.

The objective is to present financial information that reflects the substance of group relationships rather than legal form, enabling users to assess the financial position, performance, and cash flows of a group as a single economic entity, as well as the parent entity on a stand-alone basis where required. Consolidation principles ensure comparability, transparency, elimination of intra-group effects, and consistent application of accounting policies across the group. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Scope & applicability</strong><br>These standards apply to parent entities preparing consolidated financial statements, investors with subsidiaries, associates, and joint arrangements, and entities presenting separate financial statements. PSAK 65 governs consolidation based on control; PSAK 4 governs separate financial statements; PSAK 22 and PSAK 38 address business combinations; PSAK 58 covers disposals and held-for-sale classifications; PSAK 15 governs equity accounting; PSAK 66 addresses joint arrangements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Core consolidation principle</strong><br>An entity consolidates another entity when it controls it. Control exists only when the investor has power over the investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement, and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. All three elements must be present simultaneously and continuously reassessed. Control is assessed based on substance, not merely legal ownership. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Consolidated financial statements — PSAK 65</strong>.<br>Consolidated financial statements present the parent and its subsidiaries as a single economic entity. All assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of subsidiaries are combined line by line with those of the parent. <br>- Uniform accounting policies must be applied across the group; reporting dates must be aligned (or adjusted if different). <br>- Intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full to avoid double counting. <br>- Non-controlling interests (NCI) are presented separately within equity and profit or loss. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Definition and assessment of control</strong>.<br>Control assessment considers substantive rights, potential voting rights, contractual arrangements, de facto control, and structured entities. <br>- Power arises from rights that give the current ability to direct relevant activities. <br>- Variable returns include dividends, residual interests, synergies, fees, and other benefits. <br>- Continuous reassessment is required when facts and circumstances change. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Non-controlling interests (NCI)</strong>.<br>NCI represent equity interests in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the parent. NCI are recognised at acquisition either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets (policy choice applied consistently). <br>- NCI share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributed even if this results in a deficit balance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Loss of control</strong>.<br>When a parent loses control of a subsidiary, it derecognises the subsidiary’s assets, liabilities and NCI, recognises any retained investment at fair value, and recognises the resulting gain or loss in profit or loss. <br>- Amounts previously recognised in OCI are reclassified or transferred directly to retained earnings as required by relevant PSAKs. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Separate financial statements — PSAK 4</strong>.<br>Separate financial statements are those presented by a parent, investor or venturer in which investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are accounted for on a basis other than consolidation or equity method. <br>- In separate financial statements, investments are measured either at cost, in accordance with PSAK 71 (fair value), or using the equity method (policy choice applied consistently by category of investment). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Purpose of separate financial statements</strong>.<br>Separate financial statements provide information about the parent entity’s own financial position and performance, independent of group consolidation. <br>- They are often required by regulators, shareholders or legal statutes and are presented in addition to, not instead of, consolidated financial statements (except where consolidation exemption applies). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Business combinations — PSAK 22</strong>.<br>A business combination is a transaction or event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. PSAK 22 requires the acquisition method to be applied. <br>- Identify the acquirer and acquisition date. <br>- Recognise and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value. <br>- Recognise goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Goodwill accounting</strong>.<br>Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred plus NCI and previously held interest over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. <br>- Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment under PSAK 48 and whenever indicators of impairment exist. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Business combinations under common control — PSAK 38</strong>.<br>Transactions between entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method. <br>- Assets and liabilities are recognised at their carrying amounts. <br>- No goodwill is recognised; any difference is presented within equity as additional paid-in capital or similar reserve. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Disposals and assets held for sale — PSAK 58</strong>.<br>Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction and the sale is highly probable. <br>- Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Discontinued operations</strong>.<br>A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area. <br>- Results are presented separately in profit or loss to enhance comparability of continuing operations. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Equity accounting — PSAK 15</strong>.<br>The equity method is applied to investments in associates and joint ventures in consolidated financial statements. <br>- The investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and OCI of the investee. <br>- Distributions received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Associates and significant influence</strong>.<br>An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence, generally presumed with 20%–50% of voting power, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise. <br>- Significant influence includes participation in policy decisions, representation on the board, and material transactions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Impairment of investments accounted for using equity method</strong>.<br>Investments accounted for using the equity method are tested for impairment under PSAK 48 when objective evidence of impairment exists. <br>- Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and reduces the carrying amount of the investment. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Joint arrangements — PSAK 66</strong>.<br>A joint arrangement exists when two or more parties have joint control, requiring unanimous consent over relevant activities. PSAK 66 classifies joint arrangements as joint operations or joint ventures. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Joint operations</strong>.<br>In a joint operation, parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. <br>- Each operator recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in its own financial statements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Joint ventures</strong>.<br>In a joint venture, parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. <br>- Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in consolidated financial statements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Uniform accounting policies & reporting periods</strong>.<br>Group entities must apply uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events. <br>- If reporting dates differ, adjustments are made for significant transactions between dates, or statements are prepared to the same reporting date where practicable. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Intra-group transactions and unrealised profits</strong>.<br>All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. <br>- Unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated against the carrying amounts of related assets. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Disclosure requirements</strong>.<br>Entities must disclose information that enables users to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on financial position, performance and cash flows. <br>- Disclosures cover subsidiaries, NCI, associates, joint arrangements, structured entities and significant judgements made in determining control or influence. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Exemptions from consolidation</strong>.<br>A parent may be exempt from presenting consolidated financial statements if it is a wholly-owned or partially-owned subsidiary and specific criteria are met, including availability of IFRS-compliant consolidated statements by an ultimate or intermediate parent. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (PSAK)"> <strong>Presentation & consistency</strong>.<br>Consolidated and separate financial statements must be clearly identified and presented consistently from period to period. <br>- Comparative information is required and changes in group structure must be fully disclosed and explained. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 25</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
