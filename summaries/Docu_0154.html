Objective: to ensure the financial statements reliably and auditablely present the statement of financial position, operating results, changes in net assets and cash flows; to meet the reporting obligations to donors, regulators and stakeholders; and to facilitate inter-period comparability while adjusting terminology/presentation to reflect the non-profit character.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Scope</strong><br>Governs the preparation and presentation of the five minimum financial statement components for non-profit entities that prepare financial statements under Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (SAK — PSAK/ISAK). Applicable to all entities whose primary purpose is not commercial profit, regardless of legal form or funding source. Not intended to replace recognition/measurement rules in other specific PSAKs (e.g., property, plant & equipment, investments, employee benefit liabilities) — entities shall follow the relevant PSAK(s) for measurement and recognition.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Key definitions & core recognition principle</strong><br>• <strong>Non-profit-oriented entity:</strong> an entity whose resources are provided without the expectation of proportionate economic returns to the providers.<br>• <strong>Net assets:</strong> the residual of assets less liabilities (replacement for the term “equity”).<br>• <strong>Net assets with donor restrictions:</strong> resources subject to donor-imposed restrictions (purpose, time or other conditions).<br>• <strong>Net assets without donor restrictions:</strong> resources available for general use by the organisation.<br>• <strong>Control of resources:</strong> the entity recognises donations/grants when it controls the resources and when donor conditions (if any) do not create a liability or remain unmet.<br><strong>Core principle:</strong> statements are prepared on an accrual basis; classification, line titles and descriptions may be adapted to reflect the non-profit character without reducing the quality of reporting.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Core principles / Key principles</strong><br>1. Comply with PSAK for measurement; use ISAK 35/335 for non-profit presentation adjustments.<br>2. Use the term <em>net assets</em> (amounts with/without restrictions) instead of <em>equity</em>.<br>3. Present the minimum financial statement components in accordance with ISAK 35/335 (Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Net Assets, Statement of Cash Flows, Notes).<br>4. Separate and clearly disclose donor-restricted resources; reclassify only when restrictions are satisfied.<br>5. Maintain consistency of presentation between periods; disclose and explain any reclassifications and their effects.<br>6. Enhance transparency: disclose accounting policies for recognition of donations, measurement of non-cash benefits, allocation of shared costs and support services.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Governance & responsibilities (RACI)</strong><br>• <strong>Board / Trustees:</strong> approve accounting policies, the annual report and policies for use of restricted funds.<br>• <strong>Director / Executive Director:</strong> ultimate responsibility for compliance and stewardship of donor funds.<br>• <strong>Finance Director / CFO:</strong> owner of policy implementation for ISAK 35/335, oversight of statement preparation, disclosures and auditor relationship.<br>• <strong>Accounting team:</strong> prepare journals, ledger, schedules for net asset classification and notes preparation.<br>• <strong>Programme managers / Budget holders:</strong> verify restricted fund use in accordance with donor conditions and sign allocation evidence.<br>• <strong>Internal Audit / Compliance:</strong> review compliance with classification and disclosure; sample donor→GL reconciliations.<br>• <strong>External Auditor:</strong> express an audit opinion on fair presentation and compliance with ISAK/PSAK.  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Components of financial statements (mandatory & illustrative layout)</strong><br>Minimum presentation: <br>• <strong>Statement of Financial Position</strong> — show current/non-current assets, current/non-current liabilities, and total net assets presented separately (with/without restrictions).<br>• <strong>Statement of Comprehensive Income</strong> — revenue (unrestricted/restricted donations), program expenses, administrative expenses, period surplus/deficit.<br>• <strong>Statement of Changes in Net Assets</strong> — movement of restricted vs unrestricted net assets; opening-to-closing reconciliation.<br>• <strong>Statement of Cash Flows</strong> — direct or indirect method; classification of operating cash flows should reflect non-profit character (e.g., receipts of restricted donor funding shown separately).<br>• <strong>Notes to the Financial Statements</strong> — accounting policies, details of donor restrictions, summary of major programmes, commitments/contingencies, and resource management information.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Presentation adaptations & acceptable terminology</strong><br>• Titles may be adapted (e.g., “Statement of Changes in Net Assets” instead of “Statement of Changes in Equity”).<br>• Line items may be labelled to reflect sources (e.g., “Cash donations”, “In-kind contributions”, “Grants with restrictions”).<br>• Explanations must state that terminological adjustments do not change the underlying accounting principles.

If conditions create a present obligation to return funds, initially recognise as a liability (deferred income).<br>• <strong>In-kind contributions:</strong> recognise when measurable and controlled (e.g., donated services only when recognition criteria are met — professional services that would otherwise be purchased). Provide measurement basis (fair value) and disclose valuation method.<br>• <strong>Exchange transactions (fees for service):</strong> apply relevant PSAK revenue recognition (measure and present as exchange revenue).<br>• <strong>Government grants / capital grants:</strong> present separately; capital grants are often deferred and amortised to match depreciation when restricted to asset acquisition.   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="ISAK 35 / ISAK 335: Presentation of Financial Statements of Non-Profit-Oriented Entities"> <strong>Expense recognition & allocation (program vs support)</strong><br>• Recognise expenses on an accrual basis by function and nature.
