Some neighborhoods were open and plotted on grids, whereas others, like the Barbican Estate, were so serpentine that tourists could only navigate them by following yellow road markings. Hillier devised the mathematical term <em>intelligibility</em> to capture the complexity of each neighborhood. Intelligibility scores ranged from zero to one, where “unintelligible” neighborhoods with low scores were more likely to ensnare newcomers. Hillier’s intelligibility score applies to other domains of complexity, too. For example, every maze you’ve ever encountered has an intelligibility score that captures its difficulty. Hillier’s key insight was that the same complexity that caused people to get stuck when they were navigating neighborhoods and mazes also described the complexity of life more broadly. Simplification, Hillier implies, is the most reliable remedy: strip away unnecessary paths and signals so that local cues reliably indicate global structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Simplify the unintelligible — diagnostic medicine as an example</strong>:<br>The best way to get unstuck, according to Hillier, is to simplify the unintelligible. Strip away complexity, and you carve a straighter path from beginning to end. That’s especially true when the concept is inherently complex. Take the domain of diagnostic medicine. The human body combines dozens of bones, hundreds of miles of hair, tens of thousands of miles of blood vessels, and trillions of cells. Humans are susceptible to more than ten thousand identified diseases, many of them so rare that doctors have only ever identified a handful of cases. Doctors navigate this web of ailments with a total of several hundred treatments and cures, leaving many diseases difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. For those knotty cases expert diagnosticians are called in to make sense of what appears to be noise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Thomas Bolte — the “zebra hunter” and the virtues of exhaustive listening</strong>:<br>For the most complex cases, expert diagnosticians like New York City’s Thomas Bolte are called for a fresh opinion. “In mainstream medicine there’s an expression: ‘When you hear hooves, don’t initially look for zebras,’ ” says Robert Scully, who has worked alongside Bolte. “As a result, zebras are missed all the time. Tom’s a zebra hunter.” Bolte’s focus on complex diagnostics has earned him the title the Real Dr. House, recalling the TV doctor played by Hugh Laurie, who diagnosed exceptionally complex cases that eluded his colleagues. Bolte shines when the proverbial hoofbeats of disease belong to zebras rather than horses. Bolte has a boyish crop of thick hair, and Rollerblades between his office and the apartments of his homebound patients. He’s a man of science, but also a spiritualist who favors Jungian psychology and the importance of keeping an open mind. He spends an unusually long time listening to his patients, asking them dozens or even hundreds of questions before settling on a diagnosis. Though he treats these patients with humanity, he recognizes their ailing bodies for the machines they are: mechanical, governed by certain laws of science, and prone to a finite set of afflictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Origins and apprenticeship — Bolte’s formative experience with repair</strong>:<br>Bolte learned to diagnose as a child, but his first patients were houses rather than people. His father succumbed to melanoma when Bolte was a boy, and his mother, Rosemarie, supported her two children by renovating and renting out dilapidated homes by the sea on Long Island. Rosemarie’s tenants tended to trash those houses, so she employed a team of handymen to repair them from one lease to the next. Tom watched those men work, and soon he could manage basic plumbing, carpentry, drywall hanging, and electrical jobs. Later, he graduated to fixing appliances, cars, and computers and came to believe that even the most complex repairs were to some extent formulaic. Understand the formula and you could make the repair. That was true of simple home repairs, appliance overhauls, and even fixing sick people. This formative apprenticeship shaped Bolte’s conviction that complexity can be wrestled into predictable patterns if you learn the underlying rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>The 32-page questionnaire — externalizing taxonomy into procedure</strong>:<br>As a young diagnostician, Bolte learned the importance of simplifying the task. In Hillier’s language, Bolte approaches the unintelligible maze of the human body with an algorithm that almost always ends in a successful diagnosis. Bolte’s algorithm is a questionnaire that runs for thirty-two pages. Every patient completes the questionnaire, which covers, among other topics, family medical history, social behavior, habits and hobbies, employment, exposure to household chemicals, and foreign travel. Most patients spend between two and four hours completing the questionnaire, and for Bolte their responses are the first step in making them well. He has refined the questionnaire over time, pouring all the intricacy of diagnosis into this simplifying mold. The questionnaire is the cognitive scaffold that turns infinite possibilities into a bounded search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Slow, methodical, and patient — process over throughput</strong>:<br>Bolte isn’t the quickest diagnostician—but he is among the most likely to make a breakthrough. He moves forward, slowly and methodically, and, more often than the vast majority of his colleagues, finds his way to the solution. He has worked in traditional medical practices, but their emphasis on speed doesn’t work for him. Insurance companies rank physicians according to how many patients they see per hour—a sort of “batting average”—and by this metric, at most of his practices he finished dead last. “There was a time in this country when doctors made house calls, and when they were done,” he says, “they sat down to dinner with the family. That’s how they got to know you. The next time someone in your family took sick, the doctor knew their context. He knew what their home life was like, knew what they did for a living, and so on. Today you’re lucky if your doctor sees you for twelve minutes. How can you possibly find out all you need to know about a patient in twelve minutes?” Bolte doesn’t have dinner with his patients, but his exhaustive questionnaire does much of the information gathering that those ongoing social relationships achieved before modern medicine became a commodity. He has reduced his process to an algorithm because he knows that the complexity of medical diagnosis is paralyzing. Without simplification, identifying a zebra among horses is next to impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>A law-student’s bus-ride anecdote — triage and expert compression</strong>:<br>Bolte’s story reminded me of an experience I had more than twenty years ago as a young law student. Between classes, I worked part-time at a large commercial law firm in the heart of Sydney, a forty-five-minute bus ride from my home in the city’s northern suburbs. I spent many of those bus rides reading legal cases in preparation for law classes. Over the years I read hundreds, maybe thousands, of judgments, hoovering a mountain of criminal law, contracts, property law, torts, and cases from many other branches of the law. Cases are often exhausting to read. Judges aren’t known for writing beautifully or simply, and many older judgments are written in impenetrable legalese. Every few minutes my mind would wander, and I’d have to go back and reread large chunks of text. Sometimes I fell asleep midcase, and when I woke up, I’d start again. On some of those bus rides, I shared my seat with a prominent lawyer who’d been in practice for thirty years. In Australia, the profession is divided between solicitors, who largely prepare cases, and barristers, who largely argue cases in court, in front of judges. About 10 to 15 percent of the most senior barristers are honorifically known as Senior Counsel. My seatmate was a Senior Counsel, one of the top barristers in the country. He was (and still is) brilliant—impossibly knowledgeable about the law, and quick on his feet during an oral argument. During some of our shared bus rides, he was accompanied by a stack of ring-bound folders jammed with legal documents. When there were too many to carry, he would use a small hand trolley to lug them onto the bus. If you gave me a week alone, without interruption, I couldn’t possibly read through and process the information in one bus ride’s worth of that lawyer’s folders. But he did just that. We would talk for ten minutes, then he would apologize and begin reading. He picked up each of the folders, one after the other, and leafed through them quickly, and then sometimes slowly. He would pause on some pages for a couple of minutes, then largely ignore hundreds of other pages, before stopping again at another critical page. These bus rides began around seven thirty in the morning, and I knew he would be in court a couple of hours later, delivering oral arguments for five or six hours based on what he had read during our shared ride. One morning, incredulous, I asked, “How can you possibly go into the courtroom for hours with so little preparation?” The process was unintelligible to me, but for this lawyer, as with Thomas Bolte, the algorithm was simple. “I’ve been doing this for a long time,” he told me (I’m paraphrasing here). “Each of the cases rests on a few subtle pieces of information—critical evidence or a crucial fact. Understand that, and combine it with a lifetime of legal knowledge, and you can argue your case for days on end.” I couldn’t match his legal knowledge, but I took seriously the importance of learning to simplify thousands of bits of information into their essential components. You don’t learn by reading everything, but by figuring out which parts you don’t need to read. I wasn’t reading thousands of cases during law school because I’d need to apply the ideas from those old cases to new cases. I was reading them to learn to simplify—to recognize the difference between essentials and distractions. The same was true for Bolte, whose thirty-two-page questionnaire was the written version of his essentials. Decades of medical knowledge for Bolte, and legal knowledge for the lawyer on my bus, were distilled into a series of steps that made complex tasks simple. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Taxonomy, labeling, and the cognitive limits of unbounded complexity</strong>:<br>Turning unintelligible mazes into streamlined algorithms has a meta flavor to it because the process itself requires the use of an algorithm. The algorithm’s first step requires that you become a taxonomist. Taxonomy is the science of naming or classifying, and the first step in simplifying is to name or classify every aspect of the complex process you’re trying to streamline. For diagnosticians like Bolte this might involve listing every symptom, and pairing it with potential diagnoses. For example, most of the time a cough signals bronchitis or an upper respiratory tract infection—but then there are the zebras: occasionally, a cough signals an allergic reaction to medicine, asthma, lung cancer, or whooping cough. For lawyers, the taxonomy might identify the key issues on which a case is likely to rest—the legal rules that are most likely to be debated in the courtroom. With the ingredients labeled, the next step is to organize them. Do some tend to go together more often than others? Do constellations of medical symptoms or legal issues tend to occur together? In medical terms, do symptoms cluster together to form syndromes that in turn inspire diagnoses? From the outside, Bolte can appear rambling or nonchalant, but in his head he’s examining a list of potential leads to determine whether they’re dead ends or open paths to elusive zebras. Bolte’s list, though long, is <em>finite.</em> One of the problems with complexity is that it can seem unbounded. If you don’t know where the world ends, it’s impossible to gain a sense of control, so you’re far more likely to get stuck. But once you’ve identified the boundaries, regardless of how expansive the territory you need to cover, you’ve turned an impossibly complex web into an intelligible algorithm. That’s what labeling and organizing does—it provides the ingredients that become, for example, a thirty-two-page questionnaire that guides you from darkness to light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Friction audits — definition, method, and three objectives</strong>:<br>What Bolte does for diagnosis, I have been trying to do for companies and individuals around the world for the past several years. I call this simplifying of the complex a <em>friction audit</em>. Just as an auditor might examine a company’s financial books, I examine processes and businesses for friction points. Say, for example, you run a small online store that sells sports shoes. Potential customers take a journey that begins when they discover your store and ends—ideally—when they buy a pair of shoes. Today it’s possible to trace these customer journeys. You can track how a customer finds your store, which links she clicks on, which pages she visits and for how long, whether she leaves the site, and how long it takes her to buy. In the best case, a customer says, “I need a pair of Nike running shoes.” Over, say, fifteen minutes, she searches Google for <em>Nike running shoes</em>, discovers your store, browses your inventory of women’s Nike running shoes, chooses a pair, adds it to the shopping cart, and checks out. This sort of friction-free journey is rare. Instead, most customers experience multiple friction points along the way, some of which may lead them away from your store. They may find your home page confusing, they may click the wrong button when shopping, your website may not work properly, they may struggle to choose among an overwhelming array of shoes, and so on. Each of these friction points shows up in the data you collect through your website’s server. Bottlenecks appear in the form of time spent on each page. You might see, for example, that hundreds of visitors to your site sail through the first few pages easily, but routinely struggle to navigate the shopping cart interface. They might spend an average of ten minutes trying to check out, and many may return to the cart and your website two or three times before completing the purchase. Worse still, many might not purchase the shoes they’ve placed in the shopping cart. A friction audit is designed to achieve three ends: to locate these sticking points; to remedy them by simplifying the complex or smoothing the inelegant; and to check later that the remedies have worked. That’s it. Three steps that, completed correctly, make a huge difference to how businesses perform and people live their lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Commercial real estate example — locating friction and low-cost remedies</strong>:<br>A few years ago I worked with a number of commercial real estate companies. Some of them specialized in shopping malls. They noticed that some customers came to their malls, spent hours wandering through stores and along walkways, but seemed to leave suddenly after purchasing none of the items they intended to buy. This was a puzzle. Why would people waste hours of their lives only to leave in a hurry? The answer, which comes as no surprise to me because I have two small kids, is that their children demand a rapid exit. Most kids don’t mind shopping for a little while, but stay too long and their—and therefore your—world ends. Some of these malls were losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue a month because parents couldn’t complete the shopping trips they’d begun. This was the first step of the friction audit: locating the friction point. The second step was figuring out a solution. How do you pacify kids who’ve hit their limit? The answer turns out to be fairly simple and inexpensive: invest a modest sum of several thousand dollars in a decent kids’ play area. Add a jungle gym to the middle of your mall, and you’ve created a waypoint for grumpy kids and their exasperated parents. Instead of leaving, parents know to break midway through their shopping trips. IKEA stores have known this for a while. Many have a kids’ play area called Småland, which functions as a free day care center. “IKEA Småland coworkers will take care of your children for free for an hour,” the IKEA website explains. Shopping centers and stores in Germany, China, and India have introduced a version of Småland for another traditional sticking point: husbands who prefer not to be shopping. These “husband storage facilities,” as one Chinese mall calls them, are stocked with beers, gaming consoles, and TVs playing wall-to-wall sports. Whatever you think of these solutions, they work. They keep shoppers in stores for longer than they might otherwise stay, and the cost of running a Småland or a “husband storage facility” is dwarfed by the extra revenue these stores and malls enjoy because shoppers can complete intended purchases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Friction audits apply to life — chocolate, habit architecture, and perceptible consequences</strong>:<br>This friction audit process isn’t just about streamlining sales; you can apply it to life at large. Friction is at the heart of being stuck, and the friction audit gives you an algorithmic tool for both finding and weeding out unwanted friction points, and for inserting friction points to prevent unwanted behaviors. If you’re eating poorly, or stuck at a punishing job, or struggling to find time to exercise, a friction audit spotlights the problem, which in turn tells you where you need to intervene. Take the case of eating more chocolate than you’d like, which is a weakness of mine. Many people eat poorly because too little friction separates them from the unhealthy food they’re trying to avoid. For several reasons, eating chocolate is, for me, a frictionless experience. There’s often chocolate somewhere in my house, so I don’t have to go far to find it. It’s usually in the same place in my pantry, so I know where to look. Each time I eat it, I feel good and don’t immediately see the downsides of eating too much chocolate over time. (I imagine people would eat healthier foods if each bite automatically showed itself as a small, visible change on our bodies.) In the past, I’ve used a kind of friction audit to trim my chocolate consumption. Taking each of the three issues I mentioned above: I stop buying chocolate; when I do have it at home, I store it in places where I’m less likely to stumble on it automatically (so I have to be mindful about eating it); and—the key—I make the negative consequences of eating it perceptible. One trick some experts recommend is putting chocolate in a small cupboard near a mirror where you’re forced to watch yourself—to look into your eyes—as you retrieve the chocolate. If you’re trying to avoid it, answering to your reflection as you pull the chocolate from the cupboard is a surprisingly effective friction point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Why formulas and checklists alone are not enough</strong>:<br>Friction audits are tools for simplification that can be applied by almost anyone, though there’s an art and science to applying them well. This is true of most simplification aids. If they’re truly formulaic, why can’t just anyone use them effectively? Why, if Bolte’s approach to medical diagnosis is formulaic, can’t other doctors use the same formula for getting unstuck when faced with tricky diagnoses? If legal briefs turn on a few key nuggets, why can’t every lawyer digest thousands of pages of evidence on a thirty-minute bus ride? Something must distinguish these giants from the doctors and lawyers who got stuck before them and were unable to find a solution. These formulas are incredibly powerful, and if other doctors and lawyers applied them, they’d find themselves, say, 80 percent of the way toward the same outcomes. A lot of education works like this. Give people the frameworks and tools to master a new skill, and they’ll develop a serviceable version of that skill. They may not move mountains, but they’ll succeed, and they’ll often get unstuck when they encounter boundaries. To see the power of these formulas, you just have to ask experts how they simplify the complex. Consider storytelling and narrative. Stories well told are the foundations of empires. Disney’s success is built on great storytelling. Without the intellectual property of compelling stories, Disney’s technical prowess as an animation and production company means nothing. In theory, there’s no limit to the number of different narrative arcs that might define a good story. Stories could zig and zag unpredictably, splintering into as many different narrative maps as there are lives lived by Earth’s billions of inhabitants. No two lives are exactly the same, but stories adhere to a narrow set of paradigms and principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Rules, guidelines, and the role of judgment — Pixar, Miyamoto, Parker & Stone</strong>:<br>For a month and a half, in 2011, a story artist at Pixar—a Disney subsidiary—named Emma Coats published twenty-two tweets summarizing Pixar’s approach to storytelling. Each tweet described a “rule of storytelling” that Coats and her colleagues turned to when constructing film narratives. She explained that she’d learned these basics from some of her more senior colleagues. The list attracted considerable attention, because Coats specifically, and Pixar broadly, are storytelling experts. Pixar revolutionized the animated film industry with franchises like <em>Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., The Incredibles,</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em>, and Coats worked on, among other films, Pixar’s <em>Up, Brave</em>, and <em>Monsters University</em>. Among other items, the list included: <em>4. Once upon a time there was <strong><em>. Every day, </strong></em>. One day <strong><em>. Because of that, </strong></em>. Because of that, <strong><em>. Until finally </strong></em>.</em> This fourth rule is nothing if not formulaic. It boils down storytelling to the idea that change—deviations from the past, and the results of those deviations—is the stuff of interesting narrative. Coats’ sixth rule is similarly formulaic: <em>6. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?</em> This rule advocates challenging characters with hardship—and, combining rules 4 and 6, suggests that narratives leap forward with opposites and contrasts. A story becomes interesting when consistency and strength meet their opposites in change and weakness. Many of the rules deal with getting stuck. Coats knows that writing stories is hard, and storytellers sometimes meet proverbial brick walls: <em>5. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.</em> <em>9. When you’re stuck, make a list of what </em>wouldn’t<em> happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.</em> <em>11. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.</em> These twenty-two rules are formulas for getting unstuck. That’s not exactly how Coats described them, but that’s how they work. And they aren’t the only rules for getting unstuck, or getting started, in narrative writing. Screenwriter Ken Miyamoto has published a list of ten narrative structures that describe some of the greatest films of the last hundred years. “Screenplay structure has nothing to do with mythology or saving a cat,” Miyamoto begins. “It’s all about basic choices a screenwriter can make to determine how they want to tell their story. It’s actually pretty easy: you just have to know what structures you can play with.” Among the options, Miyamoto describes the three-act structure (the setup; the conflict; the resolution), which describes action plots including <em>Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark,</em> and <em>Die Hard</em>. In contrast, the real-time structure follows an event in the moment, as in <em>12 Angry Men</em> and the TV series <em>24.</em> Other structures include multiple timelines, reverse chronology, and circularity, in which the end of the film returns to its beginning. Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s pragmatic advice—avoid sequences that are merely “and then, and then”—reduces narrative drift: between beats there should be <em>therefore</em> or <em>but</em>, not a succession of inert events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>The bias to add — Klotz’s subtraction experiments</strong>:<br>Though simplification is effective, people often fail to pursue it because it’s completely counterintuitive. For whatever reason, people are more likely to add to or complicate a situation before they even consider subtracting from or simplifying it. A couple of years ago, Leidy Klotz, an engineer and expert in behavioral design, watched as his son, Ezra, played with LEGO bricks. “My son was about two and a half at the time, and we were building a LEGO bridge,” Klotz said. “One column on the bridge was longer than the other, so to make the bridge level, I turned around to grab a block to add to the shorter column. By the time I turned back, Ezra had removed a block from the longer column.” Removing an element often leads to better design, Klotz realized, but he was struck by his instinct to add to rather than to subtract from the structure. “One example we love,” he said, “is balance bikes—the pedal-less, miniature bikes that allow two-year-olds to ride. If you’ve seen a two-year-old move on these things, it just makes you disappointed that you didn’t have them when you were a kid. The breakthrough was just taking away the pedals.” For decades, engineers had added training wheels, but removing the pedals is a far more effective way of teaching small kids to balance—the primary skill involved in riding. Klotz moved his observation to the lab, where he presented two hundred people with a puzzle. He gave them a small, unstable LEGO structure in which a figurine stood beneath a ceiling of LEGO bricks. The ceiling balances on a single, small piece that in turn sits on a more stable, larger set of blocks. The task is to make sure the structure doesn’t collapse when a standard brick is placed on the ceiling. To achieve this, you can add towers of bricks to the structure, which steadies the roof, or remove that one single small piece, which allows the ceiling to rest directly on the stable set of larger blocks. Klotz told the people completing his task that they would earn a small sum of money for completing the task, but that they would pay ten cents for each brick they added to the structure. Only 41 percent subtracted the single stand-alone brick; the remainder added bricks despite their cost, suggesting the intuitive appeal of adding rather than subtracting. (When Klotz also said, “Subtracting bricks is free,” 61 percent subtracted the single brick, suggesting that this intuitive error could be partially solved with a gentle nudge.) Klotz and his colleagues showed the same effect across eight experiments: unless encouraged to subtract, people tend to solve problems by adding complexity rather than subtracting and simplifying. Klotz’s work is practically important: adding is expensive and time-consuming and more likely to entrench you when you’re stuck, where simplifying, removing, and streamlining are unsticking agents. They’re more likely to lead you around or over an obstacle, and to cost you less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Constraint as a creative engine — Phil Hansen and the art of limitation</strong>:<br>Simplification is a good place to begin, but there’s more to progress than applying algorithms and formulas alone. If those were enough, every lawyer, doctor, screenwriter, and engineer would hew to an identical, canonical playbook. Obviously the very best do something different. They inject their work with a secret sauce that transcends prefabricated structures. Emma Coats, the Pixar storyteller, recognized this. Though her list was celebrated as a set of “rules,” she was quick to revise the term. On her Twitter bio, she writes, “ex-Pixar… wrote ‘22 Story Rules,’ should have called them guidelines.” For Coats, the guidelines were a launchpad. They were valuable, but they were also optional. The best writers know when to obey them, and when to abandon them, and exactly how to combine orthodoxy and iconoclasm. Rules, guidelines, formulas, and algorithms—whatever you call them in the discipline that matters to you—are valuable aids, but adhering to them all the time doesn’t work, either. The key is learning when to obey, and when to defy, and the easiest way to experiment with defiance, paradoxically, is to limit yourself by imposing constraints. Phil Hansen’s journey illustrates the paradox vividly. For years he practiced pointillism; then a tremor degraded his dots into tadpole marks. Attempting to force the old method only worsened his condition. After seeing a neurologist who advised him to “embrace the shake,” Hansen stopped fighting the constraint and began experimenting with new methods—feet, blowtorches, limited material budgets, and extreme constraints like painting with a dollar’s worth of supplies. Those constraints forced focus and produced novelty. Hansen discovered that limits can liberate creativity by reducing combinatorial overwhelm and compelling inventive recombination of the remaining elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Constraint in teams and systems — star-player limits and the London strike</strong>:<br>The same insight applies to teams. Many professional basketball teams, for example, are dominated by one or maybe two star players who spend almost every minute of the season on the court, while their lesser teammates rotate on and off the bench. These stars are involved in almost every play, acting as default options whenever their teammates look to make a pass. But what happens when these stars are injured? Researchers analyzing twenty-eight thousand basketball games between 1992 and 2016 looked at periods when star players were temporarily sidelined. Normally the ball flows A → S → B → S → C → S → D → S. The star player is a consistent node. Over time, opponents pick up on this trend and the team becomes predictable. When the star is out, the team is forced to adopt a new strategy; ball flow becomes distributed (A → B → C → D → E → C → A → E → D → B). Those forced constraints expose hidden capacities and often improve team robustness. When the star returns, the team can be stronger and less brittle than before. Similarly, from February 5–6, 2014, the London Underground strikes closed many stations and forced commuters to try alternative routes; about 5 percent of commuters adopted new, permanently faster routes, saving roughly fifteen hundred hours of commuting time per workday collectively. Shocks and constraints can thus be constructive: they break path dependence and reveal better configurations previously obscured by convenience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Deliberate defaults and automation — preserving cognitive bandwidth</strong>:<br>Removing star options and imposing constraints works in many contexts. Warren Buffett’s “twenty-slot rule” is a deliberate scarcity that forces high selectivity and focus. Pierre Soulages’s lifelong use of black paint is a color constraint that channels attention to texture and light. Writers who impose formal constraints—haiku rules, fixed meter, six-word memoirs—discover that limits clarify priorities. Automation and default choices perform the same function at the behavioral level: they replace frequent, low-value decisions with a predetermined action that conserves willpower for higher-value choices. Barack Obama and Steve Jobs famously minimized wardrobe decisions to preserve mental energy.

Once you prune the option set, deliberate recombination—pairing and tuning remaining elements—generates disproportionate returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Practical friction-audit checklist (operational steps)</strong>:<br>1.

Constraints and simplifications are tools with different goals: remove what distracts, then recombine deliberately to create new capability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Synthesis — friction audits as leverage</strong>:<br>Friction audits convert unintelligible systems into finite maps you can act upon. They combine taxonomy, low-cost interventions, and measurement. The paradox central to productive simplification is this: remove what distracts, then recombine what remains deliberately. Do that consistently and you convert bewilderment into durable advantage. Friction audits are practical, repeatable, and scalable: they locate sticking points, apply surgical simplifications, and validate outcomes. Over time they compound into organizational habit—lowering the signal-to-noise ratio for decisions and freeing cognitive resources for higher-order work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr><tr><td data-label="7 FRICTION AUDITS AND THE ART OF SIMPLIFICATION"> <strong>Appendix — quick reference: taxonomy prompts and friction categories</strong>:<br>- Structural friction: missing infrastructure, poor defaults, physical constraints.<br>- Cognitive friction: unclear choices, too many options, ambiguous signals.<br>- Social friction: norms, stigma, coordination costs.<br>- Temporal friction: long delays, waiting, poor sequencing.<br>- Perceptual friction: hidden costs, non-salient consequences. <br>Use these categories to tag friction points during mapping;

When creatives tell you they have creative block, for example, what they’re really saying is that they’re failing to meet their high standards. A painter can always apply brush to canvas, and a writer can always string words together, even if the resulting images and sentences aren’t world-changing. That might seem like a trivial distinction for an expert with high standards, but it matters because lowering your threshold, even temporarily, is often the best way to generate truly great ideas and products. That’s particularly true if you measure success by originality, because in many domains genuine originality is vanishingly rare. Often, the best way to get unstuck on the quest for originality is to combine two old ideas to form a new idea, rather than searching for a single, novel creative nugget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr><tr><td data-label="8 RECOMBINATION AND PIVOTING"> <strong>Stuck vs. perfectionism — practical diagnostic (mostly verbatim + brief synthesis)</strong>:<br>When creatives say they have block, they are frequently failing to meet their high standards.

Soon after arriving, Zimmerman began singing and playing guitar at a local coffeehouse. Occasionally he would introduce himself as Bob Dylan, but he remained Robert Zimmerman officially until 1962. Zimmerman was toying with different musical identities when he heard a record that nudged him away from rock ’n’ roll toward folk—and therefore changed the course of popular Western music. Browsing a local record store, Zimmerman bought a copy of folk singer Odetta’s 1957 <em>Ballads and Blues</em>. He later remembered that the first time he heard her, “I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top Gibson…. I learned almost every song off the record, right then and there, even borrowing the hammering-on style.” Odetta passed through Minnesota that year, and she and Zimmerman met briefly—but long enough for her to praise the young musician who was a decade her junior.<br><br>Zimmerman reported “falling in love” with Odetta. He dropped out of college at the end of that first year and moved to New York City to find his musical fortune. He saw Odetta again, in 1961, this time when she was performing the antislavery hymn “No More Auction Block for Me.” ... Then, in anticipation of his second album, Dylan recorded one of his first big hits, “Blowin’ in the Wind.” What’s striking is that for all these claims of originality, “Blowin’ in the Wind” sounds <em>a lot</em> like “No More Auction Block for Me.” They begin with the same melody and follow the same structure throughout. Dylan knows this, and Odetta knew it, too. She was good-humored about it, but she recognized the two songs overlapped to an extent that could not be attributed to chance. On her death, in 2008, the <em>New York Times</em> published a recently taped video interview with Odetta: Interviewer: “ ’Cause he stole liberally from you.…” Odetta, chuckling: “No, no, no, no. We call it… in folk music… we don’t call it stealin’ or appropriation…. It’s ‘passing on the folk tradition.’ It ain’t what you say, it’s the way you say it, right? That influence was just like a key that opened up something that was his own stuff… so I can’t even take credit for how he heard something.” Even true originals like Dylan are prone to appropriation, borrowing, or “passing on the folk tradition.” </td></tr><tr><td data-label="8 RECOMBINATION AND PIVOTING"> <strong>Three epistemic explanations for similarity (verbatim taxonomy + short implication)</strong>:<br>From least to most charitable, here are three ways to explain cases of blatant similarity. <br>1. <strong>Willful appropriation</strong> — creative people cheat, lie, and steal all the time; musicians, artists, writers, and other people who produce creative output are expedient by nature, mining past successes for nuggets they might lightly reshape for themselves. (Author’s view: I think this is rare.) <br>2. <strong>Cryptomnesia</strong> — we mistake a forgotten memory for a new idea; cryptomnesia occurs when we forget the source and believe the idea is original.

When listeners accused teen artist Olivia Rodrigo of plagiarizing Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up,” Costello said, “It’s fine! It’s how it works. You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand-new toy.” Nirvana’s drummer Dave Grohl was responsible for the thumping beats that drove “Smells Like Teen Spirit” ... “I pulled so much stuff from [disco bands] the Gap Band and Cameo, and [disco drummer] Tony Thompson on every one of those songs,” Grohl admitted. Questlove: “The DNA of every song lies in another song.” The practical consequence: if originality is recombination, the strategic task becomes tractable: collect diverse inputs, catalog promising elements, and systematically try pairings.

The alarm clock mat forces people who are deep in sleep to move their bodies to turn off the alarm, which has two important consequences: it prevents them from hitting the snooze button or oversleeping, and it forces them to stand up, which encourages their bodies to stir. Postplay short-circuits exactly this process in Netflix viewers: it keeps them in a stupor between episodes, effectively allowing them to hit snooze as they watch “just one more episode.” The solution: decide how many episodes of a show you want to watch, set an alarm to ring at a time that coincides with the conclusion of those episodes, and—here’s the kicker—place that alarm in another room or far enough away from the TV that you’re forced to walk to turn it off. You can’t continue watching mindlessly while the alarm blares in the background, and standing up to turn off the alarm breaks the show’s hold on you. It’s a simple analog solution to a digital problem, and it marries an unhelpful idea in postplay, and a helpful idea in an alarm clock mat, to generate a not-truly-original-but-effective innovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr><tr><td data-label="8 RECOMBINATION AND PIVOTING"> <strong>Snead’s small-bird metaphor — hold ideas lightly (verbatim plus application)</strong>:<br>“You should be holding the golf club with the same pressure you would hold a small bird.

Ten days later, the miners assembled in small focus groups at the research team’s headquarters. Brown attended one of the earliest focus groups. He was disappointed because the drug still wasn’t working. As the focus group ended, Brown decided to ask the men if they’d noticed or wanted to report anything else. One of the men put up his hand and said, “Well, I seemed to have more erections during the night than normal.” Brown remembers the others smiling and saying, “So did we.” Brown’s presence of mind in ad-libbing that extra question turned out to be worth tens of billions of dollars. He and his team had unwittingly discovered Viagra. Brown implored his managers to fund a follow-up study. “I need one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to do an impotence study,” Brown told the head of research and development, “and I’m not leaving your office till you give me the money.” The first trials commenced in Bristol in late 1993, and subsequent trials followed in France, Norway, and Sweden. Brown’s insight earned Pfizer almost $40 billion from the drug between 1998 and 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr><tr><td data-label="8 RECOMBINATION AND PIVOTING"> <strong>Wrigley & compound pivots (verbatim narrative + lesson)</strong>:<br>William Wrigley Jr. traveled from Philadelphia to Chicago to sell soap. “He began with nothing,” a <em>New York Times</em> obituary said, “unless $32 can be considered as capital.” Competition was keen, so Wrigley introduced a differentiator: with each bar of soap he threw in a small packet of baking powder. Customers began asking about the baking powder more than the soap; the company became the Wrigley Baking Powder Company. He then included two packs of chewing gum with each large package of baking powder. The gum was soon more popular than the baking powder, and Wrigley pivoted again—eventually selling Spearmint and Juicy Fruit. He re-framed gum’s value through sampling and marketing (military uses, breath-freshening claims), converting an impulse purchase into a staple. Lesson: follow the customer signal and be willing to convert an add-on into the core product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr><tr><td data-label="8 RECOMBINATION AND PIVOTING"> <strong>Ties Carlier & VanMoof — small tweak, large effect (verbatim case)</strong>:<br>Problem: expensive bicycles arriving bent and damaged when shipped to the USA.

With it, humans have cured diseases, led nations, and invented rockets that carry people to space and back again. Brains are greedy, though. To use yours, you must feed it hundreds of calories a day, and you must be willing to devote your time, attention, and energy to whatever task you’re asking your brain to complete. Humans manage these demands by developing patterns and habits that aren’t quite perfect, but that most of the time do a satisfactory job. When you buy a soda from a wall of options, for example, you don’t examine every label every time you buy. Instead, you reach for one of a couple of options that you’ve enjoyed in the past. Walking and driving a car are mostly automatic for most people most of the time. That’s why your mind wanders while you’re walking and driving. You have surplus brain resources to devote to other tasks.<br><br>The one downside of living on autopilot is that we sometimes find ourselves in deep ruts. The strategies and habits that simplify the business of everyday life become so entrenched that they’re difficult to escape even when we need to try something new.<br><br>The good news is that your strategies and habits are probably quite different from mine. We’ve lived different lives under different conditions and have different personalities, talents, attitudes, and values. My habits might guide me toward a rut, but your habits might set me free. That’s exactly what has happened over the past sixty years among the creatives who have worked on the TV show <em>Doctor Who</em>.<br><br><strong>Doctor Who as a long-run natural experiment</strong>:<br><br><em>Doctor Who</em> is the world’s longest-running TV show. Its first episode aired on BBC TV on November 23, 1963, at 5:16 p.m.—eighty seconds later than planned because the BBC was covering the previous day’s assassination of John F. Kennedy. The show revolves around an extraterrestrial character, known as the Doctor, who travels through time in a blue phone booth. The Doctor is fascinated with planet Earth. He takes on human form and travels with human companions as he saves innocent people from harm. He has been alive for centuries, which is possible because his soul migrates into a new human body whenever he is mortally wounded. The show owes much of its longevity to this conceit, which allows its producers to cast a new actor in the role of the Doctor whenever the previous actor decides to move on. Over the show’s six decades, thirteen actors have played the role of the Doctor, some for a single feature film, and others for over six years.<br><br><em>Doctor Who</em>’s thirty-nine regular seasons and eighteen specials have been broadcast in more than one hundred countries. The show has inspired museum exhibitions, spin-offs and fan fiction, books and merchandise, and has been featured on <em>The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, Futurama</em>, and <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. At its peak, in the 1970s, the show attracted an average of 11 million viewers per episode, and though its audience is about half as large today, it still scores up to ninety out of one hundred on the British Audience Appreciation Index, a measure of audience sentiment toward British TV shows.<br><br>As with its stable of actors, the show’s creative team is in constant flux. Each episode is driven by creative artists who occupy one of three “core” roles: producers, directors, and writers. In total there are between two and five creatives across the three roles per episode. These creatives, as with any artists, have their own style. They compose each episode through the lens of personal experience, training, and idiosyncratic preferences. For example, Graeme Harper, who directed fifteen episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em>, had a background in Dickensian theater, whereas Phil Collinson, who directed forty-seven episodes, had a background in sitcoms and comedy. John Nathan-Turner, who produced fifty episodes, was more open to violent story lines and felt strongly that the show should appeal to the lucrative US market.<br><br>Despite, or perhaps because of, its longevity, <em>Doctor Who</em> has endured many sticking points. Its audience fell by almost 70 percent in the late 1980s, and the BBC placed the show on an indefinite hiatus that lasted sixteen years. <em>Doctor Who</em> reemerged in 2005 to great fanfare, but there are fresh rumors of its demise whenever the show’s viewership declines.<br><br>The show’s highs and lows have attracted interest from researchers who specialize in team dynamics. Does <em>Doctor Who</em> fare best when its creative team is cohesive and like-minded, or is diversity a virtue? You might imagine that creative teams benefit from consistency. Directors might learn how to coax good ideas from familiar writers, and producers might discover the personalities of the writers and directors who tend to craft the best story lines. In moments of difficulty, perhaps familiarity is the best “unsticker.” This is the question one research team asked when they combed through fifty years of <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes: Are the creatives on a long-running show more or less likely to get stuck—or to flourish—when they work with familiar, or closed, networks?<br><br>The researchers began by gathering all sorts of data on each episode. Who was on its creative team? To what extent had they worked together on other episodes of the show—or indeed on other shows beyond <em>Doctor Who</em>? How did viewers feel about the episode? How creative was the episode according to <em>Doctor Who</em> experts? (The research team included a small group of devoted <em>Doctor Who</em> scholars.) Were the ideas in that particular episode unusual in the context of <em>Doctor Who</em>’s past, or did they explore similar (and therefore less creative) themes? With the data in place, the researchers were primed to measure the value of a concept known as network nonredundancy. Put simply, over the show’s life span, did creative teams benefit from an injection of new blood, or were they more likely to thrive when their networks were closed?<br><br>The answer was clear and unambiguous. Though most creatives prefer working with familiar teams, familiarity breeds friction. The best episodes emerge with new blood. “The more closed the network around an artist,” the researchers wrote, “the less creative their work.” Creatives benefit from working with new teammates, particularly when those teammates have worked in very different circles in the past. Nonredundancy—or novelty—produced breakthroughs and sometimes moved the show from periods of stagnation to periods of creative rejuvenation.<br><br>Working with new people inspires creative unsticking for at least two reasons. The first is that new people bring fresh ideas. The <em>content</em> of their creative thoughts is different, and novel ideas shuttled back and forth between two or more people unlock other new ideas. The second reason is that simply shaking things up has value. If part of getting stuck is about stubbornly sticking to old habits, introducing new people forces you to adopt a new style of thinking. As the researchers explained, this isn’t just about new content; it’s also about reorganizing old content. New blood “stimulates the adoption of new perspectives and ways of seeing, thus [allowing creatives to] successfully apply old notions in different ways.”<br><br><strong>Pixar’s engineered nonredundancy</strong>:<br><br>When you look beyond <em>Doctor Who</em>, you’ll see the value of nonredundancy over and over. In 2000, Pixar Animation Studios was riding high. Between 1995 and 1999, Pixar released <em>Toy Story, A Bug’s Life</em>, and <em>Toy Story 2</em>—three films that changed how the motion picture industry perceived animation. Traditionally, animated films were for kids. They explored simple ideas with two-dimensional drawn characters that appealed to younger audiences. But 1995’s <em>Toy Story</em> was a feature-length animated film that appealed to kids and adults alike by exploring themes that spoke to both audiences. Its visuals weren’t quite realistic, but they were three-dimensional and textured to an extent that hadn’t been possible before the mid-1990s. In 1972, the Academy Awards introduced a Special Achievement Oscar for contributions to film. The Special Achievement Oscar was awarded every few years to recognize films that transcended the established boundaries of the motion picture medium. In 1977, <em>Star Wars</em> won for its “alien, creature, and robot voices,” and in 1990 <em>Total Recall</em> won for its “visual effects.” <em>Toy Story</em> won the fifteenth such award in 1995 as the “first feature-length computer-animated film.”<br><br>With three successes under its belt, Pixar might have been content to keep doing what it was already doing so well: writing great stories that were realized with beautifully rendered animations. Instead, Pixar’s founders sought nonredundancy. They were worried the studio might grow lazy or complacent, so they introduced new blood in the form of Brad Bird, an outsider who did things very differently. Bird recalled when he was approached by Pixar’s Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, and John Lasseter: “[They said], in effect, ‘The only thing we’re afraid of is complacency—feeling like we have it all figured out. We want you to come shake things up. We will give you a good argument if we think what you’re doing doesn’t make sense, but if you can convince us, we’ll do things a different way.’ ”<br><br>Pixar’s artists were understandably invested in the integrity of every image they created for every film. They were purists because the company’s signature was its incredible animation. This was what the Academy Awards recognized when it awarded Pixar the Special Achievement Oscar in 1995, so the animators would frequently hold up a film if a particular image wasn’t perfectly rendered. Bird saw things differently:<br><br>“I had to shake the purist out of them—essentially frighten them into realizing I was ready to use quick and dirty ‘cheats’ to get something on screen if they took too long to achieve it in the computer. I’d say, ‘Look, I don’t have to do the water through a computer-simulation program. If we can’t get a program to work, I’m perfectly content to film a splash in a swimming pool and just composite the water in.’ This absolutely horrified them. I never did film the pool splash… but talking this way helped everyone understand that we didn’t have to make something that would work from every angle. Not all shots are created equal. Certain shots need to be perfect, others need to be very good, and there are some that only need to be good enough to not break the spell.”<br><br>Bird has mastered the process of making animated films, and he recognized that sometimes the only way to create excellent products on time was to fast-track their animation. He was also a big believer in the value of nonredundancy and so brought in a host of new animators and, in his words, “black sheep,” to shake things up. “A lot of them were malcontents,” Bird remembered. They had big, new ideas, but the established way worked fine, so they rarely had the chance to put their ideas into practice. “We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories, and we changed the way a number of things are done here…. All this because the heads of Pixar gave us leave to try crazy ideas.”<br><br>The first two features Bird worked on for Pixar were <em>The Incredibles</em> and <em>Ratatouille.</em> Both won Oscars for Best Animated Feature, <em>The Incredibles</em> in 2004, and <em>Ratatouille</em> in 2007. <em>Ratatouille</em>, in particular, was a half-made failure when Bird began working on the film, and many of the changes he introduced—including the requirement that all the rats apart from Remy, the central character in the film, walk on four legs instead of two—were critical to the film’s success. But perhaps his biggest move, and what made Bird famous in the industry, was his desire to work with black sheep animators—the outsiders with different perspectives whom other directors overlooked.<br><br>Bird believed that black sheep were valuable if only because they were different. Their difference, whether or not they were the most talented creatives in the business, forced the rest of the creative team to see things from a new perspective. This, he recognized, made them excellent unsticking agents when his teams hit creative roadblocks. Black sheep are, by definition, less likely to be mainstream successes. They fall at the fringes of existing networks, and so they tend to be more loosely connected to prevailing norms. A black sheep’s primary role is to offer a new perspective that researchers call a positive shock. In the words of the <em>Doctor Who</em> researchers, “The addition of new ties to an existing network represents a positive shock that pushes individuals in the network to reconsider the way they work together and coordinate.”<br><br><strong>Imperfect outsiders can be engines of change</strong>:<br><br>But here’s the critical point about black sheep—and why you should always consult outsiders for advice when you’re stuck: experiments show that even <em>incompetent</em> outsiders move a team forward. They don’t need to be oracles or geniuses. They just need to be different. According to one study, for example, we believe top performers give better advice than mediocre performers, but in fact their advice is equally good. In the case of word-unscrambling puzzles (for example, reordering the letters MYRDEA to form DREAMY), you might expect an expert unscrambler to give better advice than a mediocre unscrambler. But completing the task, and explaining how it’s done, draw on different abilities. The only difference between the best and the mediocre is that top performers give more—but not better—advice than average performers, which we mistake for <em>better</em> advice.<br><br>In another study, strangers worked together to solve an online puzzle. The strangers couldn’t interact, but each could see the moves made by the others. The puzzle could only be solved if the group worked together. The task was difficult, and sometimes the groups failed. Often they needed many attempts to find a solution. In one version of the experiment, the players in the network were humans working toward a solution. In other versions, though, some of the players were actually “noisy bots,” or artificially intelligent agents that sometimes made poor decisions. These noisy bots were modestly incompetent black sheep. Their only role was to behave randomly from time to time, which frustrated the other players and forced them to explore new strategies to solve the puzzle.<br><br>The bots may have been “noisy,” but they also helped the human players find solutions more reliably and quickly, “not only by making the task of humans to whom they are connected easier,” as the researchers wrote, “but also by affecting the game play of the humans themselves when they interact with still other humans in the group, thus creating cascades of benefit.” Shaking things up is valuable even when the person (or bot) doing the shaking isn’t herself (or itself) helpful or competent. It didn’t matter that the bots weren’t good at their jobs; what mattered is that they were <em>different.</em><br><br><strong>Diversity’s measurable effects in science and business</strong>:<br><br>If you’re stuck, the prescription is obvious: share your situation with someone new and different. It can’t hurt to speak to a wise expert, but speaking to someone new even if that someone is neither especially enlightened nor educated is valuable. We tend to be blind to our own habits and patterns, and it’s often those habits and patterns that steered us toward a rut in the first place. Nonredundant outsiders bring latent, hidden ideas to the fore by pushing us to look beyond our instinctive defaults.<br><br>Another, perhaps more familiar, term for nonredundancy is <em>diversity</em>. The more you consult with nonredundant outsiders, the more diverse your inputs, and the more likely you are to move beyond stubborn personal defaults. Though humans have been getting stuck and unstuck for millennia, for most of that time they have tackled obstacles in small, like-minded, homogeneous groups. These groups lacked diversity because their members often knew each other quite well, often lived close together, and were sometimes related or close friends.<br><br>Even as we began to favor the scientific method over trial and error, research teams remained homogeneous. Most were made up of older, rich, conventionally educated white men. As more women entered the medical profession in the 1980s and 1990s, attention shifted to diseases and health issues that affected women, including osteoporosis, menopause, and breast cancer. Part of this shift arose because the women on these medical research teams nudged them in new directions that had largely escaped male researchers. Even medical trials that were designed to examine human behavior tended to focus on men. The 1958 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging was designed to explore “normal human aging,” but for its first twenty years enrolled only men. Likewise, the researchers behind the Physicians’ Health Study recommended that low doses of aspirin taken daily might reduce heart disease, but their conclusions were based on data from twenty-two thousand male participants, and <em>zero</em> women. The 1982 Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (fittingly abbreviated as MRFIT) explored the role of diet and exercise in heart disease, but enrolled thirteen thousand men and zero women.<br><br>One research team wasn’t satisfied with scattered anecdotes, so they combed nearly 7 million publications to explore the relationship between gender diversity on medical research teams and innovativeness. Those papers were written by a total of 7 million different medical scientists across fifteen thousand different journals, between 2000 and 2019. Over time, academic fields tend to become echo chambers. The same small groups of researchers cite one another as they make increasingly incremental progress by asking ever narrower questions. One big intellectual leap might spawn hundreds or thousands of related papers that ultimately drive the field toward an intellectual roadblock. In contrast, a field that isn’t stuck draws in new researchers from allied fields, attracts citations from nonredundant researchers, and avoids becoming an echo chamber. The research group investigating diversity found that teams that included male and female researchers were more likely to do novel research that drew in novel researchers from novel fields. The diverse teams were also more likely to make a big impact, with large teams of mixed-gender researchers publishing “hit” papers 16 percent more often than large teams with single-gender researchers.<br><br>The same is true of the business world. One study examined the performance of more than one thousand firms across thirty-five countries, and twenty-four different industries, and found that gender diversity was associated with superior firm performance in countries that generally supported gender diversity in the workplace. A second team of researchers was careful to establish that diversity drove innovation by randomly assigning start-up entrepreneurs to work on teams that were either gender diverse or gender uniform. Over the course of a year, teams with a roughly even gender split outperformed those with unbalanced gender representation. A third team of scientists randomly assigned research participants in a lab experiment to work in teams that were or were not gender diverse, and they, too, found that diversity drove innovation. Diversity evades the quicksand that keeps groups, teams, firms, and even entire fields from making progress.<br><br><strong>Shane Battier — an individual-level case</strong>:<br><br>One of the great case studies in diversity as an unsticking agent is former NBA basketball player Shane Battier. Battier, who played between 2001 and 2014, was unusual in many respects. Measured against traditional basketball metrics, he was mediocre. Michael Lewis, who profiled Battier for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, wrote, “He doesn’t score many points, snag many rebounds, block many shots, steal many balls, or dish out many assists.” When Battier played for the Houston Rockets, the team’s general manager said, “He’s, at best, a marginal NBA athlete.”<br><br>But in other respects Battier was different from other NBA players. Though most NBA players are bright, Battier was a <em>scholar.</em> He graduated from Detroit Country Day School with a 3.96 GPA and won the headmaster’s cup for the best all-around student. Before each game, his coach handed him a packet of information on the opposing team—where each player was most and least likely to score, their strongest and weakest shots, and so on. “He’s the only player we give it to,” Battier’s coach said. “We can give him this fire hose of data and let him sift. Most players are like golfers. You don’t want them swinging while they’re thinking.”<br><br>As Battier combed through his nightly dossier, he learned how to use his opponents’ idiosyncrasies against them. He might recognize that a particular team relied on one or two players and so spent his night defensively neutralizing those players. Or he might learn that a particular player shot better from the left than the right and so forced the player right. He was eccentric and different—and gave his own teammates more room to play—because he didn’t play with a one-size-fits-all approach. He took each opponent as a separate and distinct challenge with his own exploitable weaknesses. This attention to detail dovetailed with Battier’s unusual selflessness. Most professional athletes are self-focused, but he always seemed to put his team first. He’d choose a strategy that might dampen his own stats if it would, on average, bring his team an extra handful of points each night. It was hard to measure the effects of his selflessness, because “being unselfish” isn’t captured by traditional statistics. To capture his magic, a different stat had to be invented—a metric known as the plus-minus.<br><br>The plus-minus measures what happens to a team’s score when a particular player is on the court. A plus-minus of five, say, means that a player’s team tends to score five more points than the opposition does when he’s on the court. By definition, the average across all players in the league at any time must be zero. Across a single season, a solid starting player might score plus-two; an all-star might score plus-four; and an all-NBA player might score plus-six—which was Battier’s average across his career. During strong years his plus-minus exceeded ten, which matched the scores of Michael Jordan and LeBron James at their peaks. Battier’s plus-minus score was astronomical, particularly relative to his other middling stats. “I call him LEGO,” his coach at the Rockets said. “When he’s on the court, all the pieces start to fit together.” Statistically speaking, having a plus-six player on the court is the difference between winning forty-one games in a season and winning sixty. This is the effect of introducing a player who is eccentric in two important ways: he knows more about how to frustrate his opponents defensively than every other player in the league and he’s supremely unselfish.<br><br>Here’s how we know Battier had a great unsticking effect. When he was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies, they were winning just 28 percent of their games. By his third year with the team, they were winning 61 percent of the time. Then he moved to the Rockets, who had a win percentage of 41 percent. During Battier’s first season with the team, that percentage rose to 63 percent, and the next season it rose to 67 percent. That season included a twenty-two-game winning streak, a mark exceeded by just three other teams in the league’s seventy-five-year history. Battier’s teams won more often when he played, and even solid opponents with all-star players whose stats dwarfed Battier’s seemed to struggle. Much of this was because of his eccentricity as a player—and much of it happened because he disrupted the status quo, unsticking his teammates and allowing them to play their own natural games more effectively.<br><br>Battier was an undeniable gift to his teams, but one potential cost of eccentricity is that it might compromise cohesiveness. Just imagine five Battier-like players on the basketball court, each playing a completely different game from the others. Battier shook things up and made way for his more conventional teammates to do what they did best, but five Battiers do not a great team make.<br><br><strong>When diversity helps most</strong>:<br><br>There’s a mountain of research about exactly when diverse ideas are most useful. The bottom line, these studies agree, is that diversity is particularly helpful when the task is complex rather than brief and simple; when it’s novel enough to resist habits and entrenched strategies; and when it requires problem-solving, innovation, or creativity. These criteria describe almost every task that rests on breakthroughs. Sticking points are frustratingly resistant to tried-and-true approaches that worked in the past, and overcoming them requires creativity and innovation.<br><br>Take, for example, someone who has an undiagnosed medical ailment. After spending $100,000 on dozens of medical visits, she’s no closer to a diagnosis. This is the story entrepreneur Jared Heyman tells about his sister, who spent three years bedridden with a rare genetic disorder. She was fortunate to draw the attention of a large, interdisciplinary group of specialists, who ultimately cracked her case, which inspired Heyman to found CrowdMed in 2012.<br><br><strong>CrowdMed: structured crowdsourcing for hard problems</strong>:<br><br>CrowdMed was designed to replicate her experience at scale, turning diagnosis into a crowdsourcing operation the same way Wikipedia turned encyclopedia-building into a collective pursuit. In exchange for a monthly fee, patients who signed up for the service shared their medical histories and waited as some of CrowdMed’s ten thousand “detectives” tried to diagnose the problem. What makes CrowdMed unusual is that, according to CrowdMed’s website, one in four of these detectives don’t “work in or study medicine.” This nonredundant, eccentric minority is the platform’s secret sauce. “That’s actually very intentional,” says the company’s CEO, Danyell Jones. Though that “sounds counterintuitive,” she says, there’s value in diversity, because “if there’s an error in [mainstream medical professionals] being able to catch something, that’s an error that’s going to be duplicated.” This minority of detectives is drawn from a long list of tangential professions, including “acupuncturist,” “audiologist,” “dentist,” “educational psychologist,” “podiatric medical doctor,” “professional clinical counsellor,” and “speech language pathologist.”<br><br>Detectives are carefully vetted, and they’re paid bonuses for valuable suggestions. They receive cash rewards and boosted ratings on the site when they solve mysteries, and CrowdMed minimizes the chances of outlandish suggestions by appointing a carefully vetted moderator for each case. A subset of CrowdMed’s users bet on which suggested diagnoses are most likely, and this patented, proprietary betting process tends to yield excellent results. The platform’s site claims, “Over seventy-five percent of medically-diagnosed patients tell us that their CrowdMed diagnosis was eventually confirmed to be correct by their physician, which is the most stringent definition of success.” An independent academic assessment of the site between May 2013 and April 2015 found similar results. Almost four hundred people stumbled on diagnoses through the site, most of them after visiting five or more physicians, and incurring more than $10,000 in medical expenses. Hundreds of case solvers participated, and almost all reported that the crowdsourcing gave insights that led them closer to the correct diagnoses.<br><br>You wouldn’t turn to CrowdMed before exhausting the obvious channels, but as the data suggest, CrowdMed is for people who are stuck. These patients have suffered for years—some for much of their lives—so they’re desperate for a solution. Obvious paths don’t make much sense because, if the answer were obvious, another doctor would already have found it.<br><br><strong>Crowdsourcing in practice: a design fix from a social post</strong>:<br><br>Crowdsourcing as an unsticking agent isn’t new. In 1714, the British government offered a cash prize to any citizen who could offer a simple method for tracking the position of ships at sea. The reward was £10,000 (around £1.5 million today) for modest accuracy, and £20,000 if the proposed method was accurate to within thirty-five miles. This crowdsourcing was possible because it was run by the government, one of the few institutions that could reach a crowd in the eighteenth century.<br><br>Crowdsourcing has never been more feasible for the average person than it is today, because almost anyone can source a crowd online. Sites like MetaFilter, Ask.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk, and Reddit draw billions of eyeballs to millions of questions, many of which boil down to pleas from the stuck and frustrated. Even people who aren’t seeking a solution sometimes find their frustration met with crowdsourced advice, as happened to Jimmy Choi. Choi is an elite athlete with early-onset Parkinson’s disease. He has more than two hundred thousand followers on TikTok, where he shares videos that document a combination of his impressive bodybuilding and athletic feats and his daily experience with Parkinson’s. On December 27, 2020, Choi posted a brief video focusing on his hand as he attempted to fish a small pill from a plastic container. The post’s caption read:<br><br>“Pharma executives: ‘Hey! Let’s make a pill for Parkinson’s patients as small as F#€KIN& possible!’<br><br>Hey Pharma companies… get a clue! Raising #parkinsons #awareness sorry, I get a little angry when I am struggling to move sometimes.”<br><br>Choi’s post caught the attention of dozens of designers and engineers who believed they could design a better pill bottle for Parkinson’s patients. One of those was Brian Alldridge, a videographer with plenty of experience as a graphic designer, but none as a product designer. Still, Alldridge tinkered and ultimately devised a 3D-printable pill bottle that seemed to do the trick. The process was pretty simple: the pill fell into a small well at the base of the bottle, and a vertical tube could be rotated to sit above the well so the patient could take the pill like vodka from a shot glass. Alldridge had little experience with 3D printers, so his original attempts to produce the bottle failed. That’s where the magic of crowdsourcing came in. TikTok’s 3D-printing aficionados took over, including a man named Antony Sanderson, who spent hours working on the project one night before printing a prototype that did the job. Others then fine-tuned the design, introducing an extra quarter turn to the bottle that prevented the pills from spilling out.<br><br>Choi was delighted with the final product. With the bottle “the anxiety level goes away,” he said. “The time it takes, and your risk of spilling these pills out on the floor in public, it’s almost zero.” The bottle is now available for $5 on Etsy, and that entire sum is donated to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. Alldridge is pursuing a patent, which he plans to release into the public domain.<br><br>Jimmy Choi was lucky to attract the attention of the perfect crowd, but sometimes the right crowd is hard to reach. For one reason or another, unsticking is sometimes a solo affair. But even when you’re alone, there’s a way to simulate the diverse inputs that remedied Choi’s pill bottle conundrum. Enter the wisdom of the “internal crowd.”<br><br><strong>The internal crowd and structured self-debate</strong>:<br><br>Much of this chapter draws on the idea that crowds are often wiser than individuals, particularly when those crowds are diverse. As the CEO of CrowdMed suggested, a collection of uniform voices is likely to make the same errors over and over, compounding rather than solving a sticky problem. Since each of us is just one person, we are, by definition, as far from “diverse” as possible. We view every problem through a single lens crafted by our life experiences, personalities, talents, and shortcomings. We can’t develop new expertise overnight or shed our biases and attitudes just because they’re hindering us today. What we can do, though, is refocus that lens by interrogating the biases and attitudes that may be keeping us mired.<br><br>One version of self-auditing is to become your own therapist. In 2019, a team of psychologists created a virtual reality environment in which users could switch between inhabiting an avatar of their own bodies (which looked uncannily like they did) and an avatar of Sigmund Freud. The Freud avatar, with his signature white beard and mustache, sat across from the research participant in a gray suit and skinny black tie. Before the session, participants shared a sticking point that they hoped to address. The most common sticking points focused on social anxiety, family issues, and work issues. For example:<br><br>“When I talk in public, I feel nervous, overwhelmed, I think that it will not go well, I start to play with my fingers, and my hands sweat, and I would like to control my emotions.”<br><br>“When I consider looking for a job, I feel insecure. I think I am not prepared to face a job that I do not know.”<br><br>Half the participants in the study inhabited their own bodies while the Freud avatar delivered generic instructions to consider the issue more carefully. The avatar welcomed them, asked them to expand on the issue, and asked them to think about the problem from a new perspective.<br><br>The other half—the participants who switched between playing Freud and playing themselves—effectively communicated with themselves, as though two separate people were in the room. (The platform altered their voices when they played Freud to deepen the sense they were speaking to someone else.)<br><br>Participants in the switching condition were moved by the experience. One week later they returned to the lab to discuss how the conversation affected them. Compared to those who spoke to a generic representation of Freud, those who inhabited his avatar were three times more likely to report behaving differently following the session, four times as likely to report feeling their problems were at least partially solved, and twice as likely to say they were more focused on solving the issue.<br><br>You don’t need a virtual reality headset to replicate this experience. All you need is a conversation with yourself where the second party to the conversation plays devil’s advocate to the first. If you think someone else is to blame for your situation, your devil’s advocate self might ask you to reconsider your role in the situation. If you’re anxious or fearful, your devil’s advocate self might ask, “What’s the worst that can happen?” Part of what makes this experience so useful is that becoming a second person allows you to shed a lot of the emotional baggage that anchors you to the sticking point. You can be more reasonable and detached as a fictional therapist than you can be as yourself.<br><br><strong>Wisdom of inner crowds: methods and evidence</strong>:<br><br>The Freud experiment was difficult and expensive to run, so the researchers recruited fewer than sixty participants. Larger-scale studies have found similar results, though. In 2008, two cognitive psychologists proposed the “wisdom of inner crowds” hypothesis when they asked people to make the same estimates twice and found that the average of those estimates was more accurate than either estimate alone. They asked questions like “What percentage of the world’s airports are in the United States?” and “What percentage of the world’s adult population can read and write?” Half the participants in that study made the second estimate immediately after the first, and the other half made the second estimate three weeks later. The delay was valuable because forgetting the first estimate made the second more independent—almost as though it came from a different person altogether. The average of the two answers delivered one after the other made them 6 percent more accurate than either answer alone, but the average was 16 percent more accurate than either answer alone when the second estimate was made three weeks later. A follow-up experiment published in 2022 showed similar results. Six thousand adults who made two estimates were more accurate on average when they imagined their first estimate was made by someone with whom they disagreed. This disagreement mindset inspired them to consider how they might initially have been wrong and pushed them to overcome some of their initial biases and misconceptions.<br><br>The wisdom of inner crowds is a useful last resort, but consulting one or more other people is far more effective. The researchers calculated that asking yourself the same question twice yields an answer about one-tenth as accurate as combining your answer with a random other person’s answer, and about one-third as accurate if you deliver your second answer three weeks later. The problem is that the reconsidered answer still overlaps with the first answer, even after a delay. You’re the same person three weeks later, so your biases and foibles remain.<br><br>Other researchers who built on this work wondered how we might best consult our inner crowds. What should we ask when we’re trying to split ourselves in two? Here’s a script that worked particularly well:<br><br>1. First, assume that your first estimate is off the mark.<br>2. Second, think about a few reasons why that could be. Which assumptions and considerations could have been wrong?<br>3. Third, what do these new considerations imply? Was the first estimate too high or too low?<br>4. Fourth, based on this new perspective, make a second, alternative estimate.<br><br>This approach also works for questions that aren’t grounded in numbers. In other studies, researchers have asked participants to “consider the opposite” of their original view, or “if you imagine you’re wrong, for a minute, how exactly are you wrong?” Consulting your internal crowd is flexible—you just have to adapt the script to the sticking point you’re battling to overcome. It’s also often worth reconsidering because follow-up responses are sometimes more valuable than first attempts. In one experiment, people were asked to invent four new pieces of fitness equipment. They tended to believe their first idea was best, but a separate panel of consumers routinely rated their second idea as superior to their first. The second was more abstract, more unusual, and in many ways more surprising because it required that the inventors go beyond their entrenched ideas about the nature of fitness equipment.<br><br><strong>Synthesis and practical implications</strong>:<br><br>It’s no accident that humans have thrived for millennia in groups. Whether in tribes or megacities, we do better together because we compensate for our neighbors’ weaknesses—and vice versa. The more complicated and sticky the problem, and the more diverse the inputs, the more valuable the crowd. Even when a real crowd isn’t available, asking yourself the same question twice is better than relying on your first instinct alone.<br><br>As easy as it is to ask yourself the same question twice, few of us naturally question our instincts. We need to be guided in the moment or taught to reconsider. There are, however, natural experimenters among us who treat every sticking point as an opportunity to test alternatives before settling on a path forward. The next three chapters examine what makes these people different from the rest of us, why they tend to be stuck relatively rarely and briefly, and what the rest of us can learn from their approach to breaking free. The first of those is an athlete named Dave Berkoff, who experimented his way onto the 1988 US Olympic team.<br><br><strong>Extended practical checklist (applied to diversity & crowdsourcing)</strong>:<br><br>- When diagnosing a persistent problem, intentionally solicit views from at least three people who are professionally or experientially distant from the core domain.<br>- Create a temporary role for an outsider (a “black sheep” consultant) whose explicit mandate is to question central assumptions and propose one or two wild alternatives; limit their time horizon to avoid cohesion costs.<br>- Use structured internal-crowd scripts: (a) make an initial estimate; (b) assume it’s wrong and list three reasons; (c) generate a revised estimate or proposal; (d) compare and iterate after a delay when possible.<br>- For crowdsourced design problems, provide a narrow, well-specified brief and a small incentive; moderate submissions to filter out unsafe or implausible suggestions while preserving novelty.<br>- When scaling innovations discovered via outsiders, institute competency gates and phased rollouts to prevent premature, unsafe diffusion.<br><br><strong>Closing proposition</strong>:<br><br>Diversity and nonredundancy function as mechanical unsticking devices. They are not mere moral prescriptions; they are operational tools that reduce correlated error, increase the space of considered possibilities, and reorganize entrenched ideas. For complex, novel, and persistent problems, deliberately introduce difference—through outsiders, crowds, internal-role switching, or institutional design—and then convert useful novelty into stable practice using replication, safety gates, and deliberate scaling. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 1</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
