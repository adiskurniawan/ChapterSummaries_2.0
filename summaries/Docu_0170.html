The policy supports transparent donor accounting, reproducible month-end close and a documented audit trail for internal and external reviewers. Examples: (a) country office records monthly utility accruals for program sites to ensure P&L reflects service consumption even if invoices arrive late; (b) pooled procurement accrual recorded to a holding fund pending donor allocation confirmation; (c) year-end accruals recorded in detail for audit pack and schedule that show source documents and calculation steps.<br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- Objective: ensure uniform treatment across entities, reduce manual errors, and provide a deterministic mapping from request → posted journal → clearance. Include this policy as an annex to the month-end SOP and link to ERP posting templates and the AccrualRequest form.<br>- One-line acceptance test: every material accrual must be traceable from AccrualRequest → supporting evidence → posted JE → clearance invoice with an unbroken audit trail. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Scope</strong><br>Applies to all program and operational accruals across the organisation, including project-level, pooled and corporate overhead accruals. Covers preparer, reviewer and approver activities, GL posting conventions, FX treatment and reconciliation to AP. Assumes accrual-basis financial reporting. Examples: (a) staff travel delivered in December but invoiced in January—accrual created in December; (b) repair services delivered at sub-office at period end—captured in accrual register and reflected in donor reports; (c) monthly deferred grant expense recognition for multi-period services.<br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- Entities: country offices, sub-offices, regional hubs and HQ. Specify which legal entity books the accrual (entity that received the service or that has the contractual liability).<br>- Materiality and consolidation thresholds must be harmonised across entities to ensure comparable reporting. Document local thresholds in LocalAppendix sheets if they differ due to currency or operational scale. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Definitions</strong><br>Accrual — An amount recorded to recognise goods or services received, or an obligation incurred, where an invoice has not been received by the reporting date. Example: unpaid electricity usage for the month. <br>Reversing accrual — A routine, period-end estimate posted with a scheduled reversal in the subsequent period to prevent duplicate expense recognition. Example: estimated office utilities accrual reversed next month when invoice posts. <br>Non-reversing accrual — An accrual recorded for definitive liabilities, multi-period obligations, or where donor reporting requires retention in the original period. Example: litigation settlement accrual that remains until settled. <br>Holding/clearing accrual — Temporary booking to a holding fund used when donor allocation is uncertain pending confirmation. Example: large pooled procurement ordered centrally where donor beneficiary split is unknown.<br><strong>Expanded guidance (additional terms)</strong><br>- Prepayment — cash paid in advance for goods/services delivered in a later period (classified as asset).<br>- Cut-off evidence — the minimal acceptable proof to support recognition (GRN/acceptance, service completion note, timesheet, signed contract clause).<br>- RequestID — unique identifier (format recommendation: ACC-YYYYMM-####). Use RequestID in all related documents and journal narratives. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Policy statements — Recognition, Allocation, Reversal, Materiality</strong><br>Recognition<br>Record accruals when goods/services are received or an obligation is incurred, supported by evidence (GRN, service completion note, timesheet, contract clause) and using the grant COA coding required by donors. Examples: (a) GRN from logistics confirming receipt of medical supplies; (b) signed consultant timesheet confirming days worked; (c) delivery note from transport provider with delivered quantity and date. <br>Allocation<br>Allocate accruals to donor funds in order of precedence: donor contract instruction; signed budget or grant agreement; pre-approved allocation matrix; standard allocation formula (for example: % effort, direct cost driver). Document allocation rationale on every request. Examples: (a) explicit donor clause: telecom cost split 70/30 recorded accordingly; (b) allocation matrix: overheads split by FTE weighting across projects; (c) formula: allocate vehicle fuel by mileage logged per project. <br>Reversal<br>Default treatment for routine period-end estimates is to post a reversing journal on the first working day of the subsequent period. Non-reversing treatment is permitted for definitive legal/contractual liabilities or when donor reporting prohibits reversal; exception approvals and rationale must be retained with the posted journal. Examples: (a) routine travel per diem accrual = reversing; (b) final settlement accrual for vendor dispute = non-reversing and documented. <br>Materiality<br>Finance leadership will publish a materiality threshold (currency and/or % of monthly burn). Accruals immaterial under the threshold need not be booked if documented and approved. Review threshold at least annually. Examples: (a) USD 200 threshold for local field offices; (b) 0.25% of monthly program burn for major country offices; (c) automatic rounding rules for micro-accruals below threshold.<br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- Evidence matrix: provide table listing acceptable evidence per accrual type (services vs goods vs salary vs travel) and minimum supporting items (e.g., GRN + PO for goods; timesheet + contract for consultants).<br>- Allocation override log: when allocation deviates from matrix, record reason, approver and related agreement reference. This log feeds Exceptions and Audit_Log.<br>- Materiality governance: specify who can authorise aggregation of immaterial items (e.g., Country FD can approve aggregation up to local threshold; above that require Regional FD). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Procedures (month-end) — Full workflow</strong><br>Cut-off confirmation — Program managers confirm goods/services received up to reporting date and initiate an Accrual Request Form with supporting evidence links. Example: program manager ticks receipt checklist and uploads GRN and signed delivery note. <br>Intake validation — Finance checks sufficiency of evidence, validates GL/project/donor codes and returns incomplete requests with a tracking ID. Example: finance returns request asking for missing timesheet or PO number and logs tracking ID ACC-2025-00123. <br>Allocation calculation — Apply allocation rule and compute local currency amount; convert to reporting currency using period-end FX rate from FX_Rates and record FX source and timestamp. Example: convert LKR amounts to USD using June 30 closing rate from Treasury feed and record rate 1 USD = 320 LKR with timestamp. <br>Journal preparation — Create accrual journal with unique RequestID and narrative “Accrual — [Vendor/Service] — YYYY-MM — ReqID”; attach supporting documents; set ReversingFlag as applicable. Example: JE0001234 created with clear memo and link to evidence stored in SharePoint or the workbook. <br>Approval — Route per Delegation of Authority; capture approver name, role and timestamp; approvals must be immutable. Example: manager approves via electronic signature system; approval captured in Audit_Log. <br>Posting and register update — Post journal to ledger and update Accrual Register with status = Posted and PostedJERef. Example: Register updated with PostedJERef = ERP-2025-06-JE0001234; ageing calculation triggered. <br>Invoice matching and clearance — On invoice receipt match to accrual: if accrual was reversed, post invoice to expense and clear reversal; if accrual not reversed, clear accrual against AP; book FX variances at clearance and document reconciling differences. Example: invoice invo-987 matched to RequestID; difference of 2% coded to project contingency or overhead per policy. <br>Reporting — Produce accrual schedule (by donor, project, consolidated) with narrative for material items and include in month-end pack. Example: month-end pack includes top-10 accruals by value with attached evidence and explanation.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — step-by-step checklists</strong><br>- Pre-close 7-days checklist (to be run by program managers): confirm receipt, upload GRN/acceptance, estimate if invoice missing, propose allocation, set ReversingFlag.<br>- Finance intake checklist: verify evidence, check PO match, compute accrual amount and currency conversion formula, validate donor allocation rules.<br>- Journal checklist: narrative, RequestID, exact GL lines, reversing indicator, supporting doc links, approver signature. Retain a signed list of journals for audit.<br>- Post-close validation: run register ↔ GL reconciliation and top-10 checks; escalate variances above materiality. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Allocation examples</strong><br>Example 1 — Shared salary: apportion monthly salary by agreed donor percentages and record allocation note linked to RequestID. Worked numeric example: Monthly salary 5,000 LC; Project A 60% → 3,000 LC to Donor A, Project B 40% → 2,000 LC to Donor B; record RequestID and supporting timesheets. <br>Example 2 — Pooled procurement: book full amount to Holding fund, create open-item and allocate once donor shares confirmed; update register monthly. Worked numeric example: Procurement invoice 50,000 LC booked to Holding Fund (Clearing); once donor split confirmed (Donor A 70%, Donor B 30%) create allocation journals: 35,000 LC & 15,000 LC respectively and clear open-item. <br>Example 3 — Overhead allocation by activity driver: rent 10,000 LC allocated by floor area or headcount across projects with worked allocation table saved in AllocationDetail.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — additional worked examples</strong><br>- Example 4: Consultant month-end accrual where timesheets available but final invoice pending: accumulate approved timesheets × daily rate; accrual = sum(approved days × rate) less any advance payments. Post reversing accrual if vendor invoice expected next month. <br>- Example 5: Service delivered across donors with partial contract-based allocation: apply contract formula (e.g., activity-based %). Document contract clause reference in AllocationNotes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>FX treatment</strong><br>Convert accruals to reporting currency at the official period-end closing rate recorded in FX_Rates. On clearance, recognise FX gains/losses to finance income/expense per policy and disclose material FX effects; retain FX source and timestamp. Examples: (a) accrual in local currency posted at closing rate 31/03; invoice paid next month at weaker currency → recognise FX loss to FXVariance account and note impact in month-end commentary; (b) for donor reports in donor currency, translate at donor-requested rate and include reconciliation to group reporting currency in disclosure schedule.<br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- FX handling rules: (1) use period-end closing rate for balance-sheet accruals; (2) use average rate for P&L allocations only where policy permits; (3) when invoice posts in different currency, compute clearance FX gain/loss as: (InvoiceAmount_ReportCurrency at invoice date rate) − (AccrualAmount_ReportCurrency at accrual rate). Document the calculation in clearance notes.<br>- FX documentation: store rate source (vendor feed or central treasury), API file or manual entry, and approver for any overrides. Keep FX revaluation schedule in Reports_Output. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Reversal decision matrix</strong><br>Reverse when accrual is a routine estimate for suppliers, salaries, utilities or travel where timing is the sole issue. Examples: (a) monthly utilities estimate reversed next month; (b) expected small petty cash expense estimated and reversed once receipts processed. <br>Do not reverse when accrual documents a definitive legal/contractual liability or when donor reporting requires recognition to remain in the original period. Examples: (a) indemnity payment due under a signed settlement; (b) grant-specific in-period expense required by donor. <br>Decision checklist — evidence present; estimate reliable; reversal does not contravene donor/statutory rules; DoA approval captured for non-standard cases. Example checklist entries: Evidence=true, Material=false, DonorRule=OK, Approver=Finance Director.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — decision matrix table (summary)</strong><br>- Routine estimate (utilities, travel, payroll accruals) → Reversing (auto).<br>- Accrual for legal/settlement/definitive liability → Non-reversing (manual monitoring).<br>- Donor-specific retention required (contract clause) → Non-reversing.<br>- If reversing accrual remains outstanding after 3 months, escalate and investigate: possible invoice missing, dispute, or error — move to Exceptions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Controls and audit trail — Forms, Register, Audit Log</strong><br>Accrual Request Form fields: RequestID, RequestDate, Period(YYYY-MM), VendorName, VendorID, Description, Amount_Local, Currency, FXRate(PeriodEnd), Amount_ReportCurrency, ProjectCode, DonorCode(s) with % split, AllocationMethod, AllocationDetail, SupportingDocsLink(s), PreparerName, PreparerDate, ApproverName(s), ApproverDate(s), ReversingFlag(Y/N), ScheduledReversalDate, Status, PostedJERef, Notes.

Example register reporting row with aging calculation and open-item flag. <br>Audit log: capture immutable entries for each change (who, when, old/new values, reason). Retain supporting evidence per statutory/donor retention requirements. Example audit entry: Mapping changed for RequestID ACC-2024-11-045 from Donor X to Donor Y with ChangeReason = Contract amendment and Approver=Head of Grants.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — control matrix & segregation of duties</strong><br>- Segregation: Preparer ≠ Approver ≠ Poster. Reconciliation owner should not be the preparer of accruals for same project. <br>- Mandatory controls: evidence present; DoA sign-off for journals; central register reconciliation to AP; monthly supervisor review for top 10 accruals. <br>- Audit readiness checklist: top-line accrual schedule, sample supporting document pack (RequestID + evidence + posted JE + invoice), reconciliation file and exception log. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Donor reporting and compliance</strong><br>Map accruals to donor reporting lines and attach required evidence (PO, contract clause, GRN, timesheet, donor authorisation). For donors that accept only cash accounting confirm permitted practice; for donors that accept accruals ensure reversal and re-posting processes comply with donor rules and reporting periods. Examples: (a) USAID/USG awards may have specific definitions of accrued/unexpended obligations—capture and document; (b) FCDO may require evidence of activity within award period—attach activity reports to accrual request; (c) local donor may disallow accruals past final report date—process extension or reclassification as host country expense.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — donor-specific notes (practical checklist)</strong><br>- Always confirm donor policy before booking to SOF. If donor policy unclear, obtain written confirmation from grants/compliance.<br>- USAID/USG: capture unliquidated obligations and ensure accruals do not inflate unexpended obligated balances incorrectly; follow agency guidance on reporting periods.<br>- FCDO/ECHO: attach narrative describing work completion date and evidence if accrual spans close to award end. <br>- Donor exceptions: record donor-specific acceptance or rejection in Grant_Metadata and store with RequestID. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Exceptions and dispute handling</strong><br>Log disputes in an Exceptions register with SLA targets (initial owner assignment within 2 business days; resolution within 15 business days). Place conflicting invoices in a clearing account while disputes are resolved. Capture resolution entries, approver and date; update request status to Closed when resolved. Examples: (a) supplier invoice allocation differs—log dispute, notify grants manager and donor contact if required; (b) amount variance after delivery—book temporary adjustment and escalate if >materiality threshold; (c) long-outstanding accrual moved to Contingency and flagged for CFO review.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — dispute lifecycle & templates</strong><br>- Exception lifecycle states: New → Assigned → In Progress → Awaiting Evidence → Escalated → Resolved → Closed.<br>- Mandatory fields for exception creation: RootCauseTag (Evidence/Mapping/FX/Invoice/Procurement), SLA target, OwnerAssigned, SuggestedFix.<br>- Escalation matrix: after SLA breach 2 days → regional escal; after 7 days → CFO notification.

Example automation: ERP reversing flag schedule posts auto reversal on first business day. <br>Invoice posted after reversal — Dr Expense 10,000 / Cr Accounts Payable 10,000. <br>Invoice posted when accrual not reversed — Dr Accrued Liabilities 10,000 / Cr Accounts Payable 10,000. Example of clearing: match AP invoice to RequestID and post clearing JE.<br><strong>Expanded guidance — multi-currency and variance entries</strong><br>- Example multi-currency clearance: Accrual booked in local LC at closing rate → AcctgEntry (local). When invoice paid in foreign currency, convert using payment date rate and record FX variance:<br> 1) At accrual: Dr Expense LC / Cr Accrual LC (at accrual FX)  <br> 2) On payment/invoice: Dr Accrual_ReportCurrency (cleared) / Cr Bank_ReportCurrency; difference → FXVariance. <br>- Variance handling policy: small variances (below immaterial threshold) can be charged to country overhead with documented approval; material variances require project-level correction. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Policy — Multi-Funder NGOs"> <strong>Accrued and prepaid expenditure (single grouped section — FULL combined content, do not reduce anything)</strong><br><strong>2.7	Accrued and prepaid expenditure — complete consolidated group</strong><br><br>Key points<br><br>•	Accruals/prepayments of a material amount should be recorded as follows:<br>o	at a minimum quarterly for quarterly reporting<br>o	monthly for an item that would materially affect the accounts<br>o	in detail at the year-end<br>o	for donor reporting as required. <br>•	Each accrual/ prepayment must have supporting documentation sufficient for audit purposes.  This should be a document either produced or signed by the supplier of the goods or services, which confirms the date of the transaction, the agreed price and payment details. This can be a dated agreement, delivery note, air ticket etc. <br>•	Where an accrual is posted which WILL reverse in either the following month or later, you MUST keep track of when the entries will reverse and then determine the relevant entry depending on whether the payment has been made. An example accruals tracker entitled “Finance Toolkit – Accruals Tracker” is available on the OneNet here.<br>•	Where an accrual is posted which WILL NOT reverse, you must still monitor the accrual and determine the relevant entry depending on whether the payment has been made.<br>•	At the end of each accounting period (including the year-end) the balance on the accruals and prepayments balance sheet accounts must be reconciled to the list of current accruals and prepayments.<br><br>Responsibilities:<br>•	the country finance director is responsible for ensuring that accruals and prepayments are recorded in line with the accruals policy and guidance below<br>•	budget holders are responsible for identifying accruals and prepayments relating to their awards, with assistance from finance and logistics staff<br><br>Definitions and explanations<br>Accruals accounting requires revenue and expenditure to be brought to account as and when they are earned or incurred and not when money is received or paid.  This is the point at which an asset or liability can be recorded.<br><br>Examples of situations where an accrual would be required are as follows:<br>•	the electricity for the office for the last 3 months has not yet been paid for (and no liability has been recorded for this)<br>•	goods that were ordered have been received, but either the supplier has not yet invoiced for them, or the invoice has been received but not recorded.<br><br>Example of a situation where an accrual would not be required:<br>•	the award is ending, the purchase order has been raised, but the goods or services have not been delivered yet. <br>An accrual can only be used once the goods or services have been delivered (or the expense posted to the accounts if the invoice has been received and approved – see Section 2.4: Payments for further details).<br><br>In the examples where an accrual is required, the obligation has been incurred and there is a liability.  An accrual is recorded as follows:<br><br>Dr Expense<br>Cr Accrual (liability) 2150/2100/2130/2140<br><br>It is possible (but much less likely) that there will be revenue to accrue.  This would occur if, for example, a section of the country office is sub-let (eg to another NGO) and this tenant has not paid SCI the rent for a previous period.  In this instance we have a debtor, as the tenant owes us rental income.  This would be recorded as follows:<br><br>Dr Accrued income 1130<br>Cr Revenue<br><br>This process does not cover the situation of award funds received locally, for example from UNICEF or Global Fund.  Refer to Section 2.10.1: Locally received funds for the procedure for this.<br><br>A prepayment exists if money has been paid for an expense that relates to the following accounting period.  For example, at 31 December rent has been paid that covers the period 1 January – 31 March:<br><br>Dr Expense (rent)<br>Cr Cash<br><br>In this situation an asset exists and expenditure needs to be reduced in the current period.

This will need to be managed by the country office and covered as part of the country office overhead.<br><br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- Monthly revaluation process: list steps — extract accrual balances by currency → apply closing rate from FX_Rates → compute FX revaluation movement → post revaluation JE to FXVariance (or other P&L account) with narrative and RequestID references for significant items.<br><br><strong>2.7.2	Differences between amounts accrued and actual expense (complete)</strong><br>There may be differences between amounts accrued and the actual expense when received, if the accrual was made on the basis of an estimate.  Where possible the difference should be coded to the budget against which the accrued expenditure was originally recorded.  If this is not possible then the difference will need to be covered by country office overhead.<br><br><strong>Expanded guidance</strong><br>- Difference handling workflow: small difference (<threshold) → code to original budget or overhead with preparer note; material difference → require budget holder sign-off and reclass journal; document root cause (estimation method, vendor pricing). Maintain monthly variance report.<br><br><strong>2.7.3	Donor guidelines (complete)</strong><br>When recording accruals and prepayments country office staff must ensure they are familiar with any relevant donor regulations. Some donors will not accept expenditure that has been paid outside of the award period, i.e. they work on a cash accounting basis. Other donors will accept expenditure paid outside the award period, provided the activity occurred in the award period and the amount is paid before the date of the final report. What about those that accept accruals that are settled after the report date?<br><br>Accruals and prepaid expenditure must not be charged to a SOF if it will not comply with donor regulations.  Country office staff must therefore work together to ensure that expenses are incurred and paid within the relevant donor regulations. The following should cover all donor award situations: <br><br>2.	Donor which only accepts cash based accounting (donor normally accepts the expense to be incurred and accounted for after the end of the award implementation period). Needs to be verified whether the donor accepts this practice.<br><br>The SOF will become inactive after the final posting date, (set after the end of the date of the award period to ensure such expenses can be posted to the SOF).<br><br>3.	Donor which accepts accruals accounting — the accrual is made during the award period, and therefore the SOF is active. As the accrual is reversed each month it must be re-posted until the invoice is paid. If the award is ending, the purchase order has been raised, but the goods or services have not been delivered yet, extention of the award should be requested rather than an accrual recorded as this approach does not comply with the accounting standards,  <br><br>When the invoice is received the accounting entries would be:<br><br>Dr Accrual<br>Cr Bank<br><br>NB. Reporting on the SOF from Agresso, the donor report will include the transactions based on the period selected. For example, if an audit expense which related to period 2 is posted as an adjustment to period 2 in period 5, then the report must be run up to period 5.<br><br><strong>Expanded guidance — donor practical checklist</strong><br>- Before booking to SOF, confirm: donor accepts accruals (yes/no), permitted timing for payments post-award, evidence standard, whether accrual reversals are acceptable for donor reporting. Record confirmation in Grants_Metadata and attach to RequestID.<br><br><strong>2.7.4	Accruals and Prepayments Process (complete — all stages combined)</strong><br><br>Stage — Notify budget holders<br><br>Prior to the period end (quarter end, year-end, end of donor reporting period as appropriate) finance should notify budget holders and the logistics department of the need to identify material accruals/ prepayments (and state what value is considered material). This identification needs to occur both at the country office and at the sub-offices. Logistics should assist with identification but ultimately it is the responsibility of the budget holders.  As an example of how logistics might help, they could produce a list of goods/ services received by the end of the period but for which no invoice had been received, detailing:<br>• goods/ services received<br>• value<br>• coding as per the purchase order<br>• budget holder.<br>This could be accompanied by a copy of the supporting documentation (goods received note etc).  In addition to goods/ services procured via logistics, budget holders should consider costs relating to property, staff/ consultants etc that might not have passed though logistics.  They should also review prior period accruals (which will have now reversed) to see if they are still outstanding and need to be accrued again. Examples: (a) logistics run a weekly GRN extract and send to budget holders; (b) budget holders run prior-month accrual aging and re-request accrual if outstanding; (c) sub-office reconciles receiving report list against central register. <br><br>Stage — Budget holders identify accruals/prepayments<br><br>Budget holders must complete the accruals/ prepayment template, sign to authorise the adjustments, and submit to finance with documentation to support the accruals/ prepayments.  <br>In the template the budget holders should identify the reversing period.  They should set this as the following month unless it is known that the period will be longer.<br><br>At sub-office level, finance should coordinate this process and then send all the documentation to the country office finance department for processing. Examples: (a) completed template sample included in workbook; (b) budget holder signs electronically and attaches delivery note and PO; (c) sub-office compiles batch and forwards to country office with summary cover sheet. <br><br>Stage — Register in Agresso<br><br>One member of the finance team should register the accruals/ prepayments journals in Agresso and print a copy. Examples: (a) junior accountant creates preliminary draft journals in sandbox and supervisor reviews; (b) posted journals receive auto-generated JE numbers which are recorded in AccrualRegister; (c) printed copy saved to physical or electronic file with the RequestID. <br><br>Stage — Review, authorisation and posting<br><br>A supervisor in the finance team should review the journals to ensure they are correct and agree to the supporting documentation and authorisations. When satisfied, they should sign the list of registered journals and templates to authorise.<br><br>The supervisor should update the journals to include the reversing period and post the journals in Agresso.  Once all the accruals/ prepayments have been posted, finance should run an enquiry on the accruals and prepayments accounts to ensure all have been set to reverse.  If the reversal has been forgotten then a manual reversal journal will be required in the following month, and should be tracked against an accruals listing maintained each month. Examples: (a) supervisor checklist includes verification of RequestID, evidence, allocation split and GL codes; (b) exception process requires escalation to Country Finance Director for any accrual > materiality threshold; (c) monthly report flagged to CFO for accruals not set to reverse.<br><br>Stage — Filing<br><br>The authorised accruals/ prepayments journals and the supporting documentation should be filed. Examples: (a) electronic folder structure: /Archive/Accruals/YYYY/MM/RequestID with zipped supporting docs; (b) retention rules: 7 years for donor-funded accruals, or donor-mandated period if longer; (c) indexing standard includes RequestID, Vendor, Period and PostedJERef.<br><br><strong>Expanded guidance — step-by-step process checklist (concise)</strong><br>1.

For repeated rejections on same supplier, run supplier quality review with procurement and record findings in the Runbook_Readme. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Exceptions (exception manager)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Central register of validation failures and disputes that require remediation: missing evidence, mapping mismatches, FX rate gaps, reconciliation variances, supplier disputes. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> ExceptionID, Category (Evidence/Mapping/FX/Match/Reconcile), Severity, RelatedRef (RequestID/JE/Invoice), Description, SuggestedFix, OwnerAssigned, SLA_TargetDays, Status, Notes, CreatedDate, ResolvedDate, EvidenceLink.<br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Auto-generated from validation rules in Power Query and manual entry by controllers or operations. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Severity must map to action (High→Controller review within 2 days). RelatedRef must be present. SLA logic enabled. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Assign owner, track progress, attach resolution evidence, escalate when SLA breached. Use filters to prioritise high-severity items. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Process Coordinator / Consolidation Operations. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Treat this as your to-do list for problems detected during ingestion and reconciliation. Each exception must have an owner and closure evidence. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Provide auto-email notification when new high-severity exceptions created. Maintain an “aging heatmap” so management sees stale exceptions. Include suggested fix templates to speed remediation (e.g., “request missing timesheet from program owner, attach to RequestID”). Record root cause tags (data, process, vendor, mapping) for long-term remediation analytics. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> Example: Missing FX rate generates FX exception — owner is Treasury with SLA 1 business day. If owner fails to act, auto-escalate to Controller. If mapping exceptions proliferate, run batch review with Mapping Steward and apply wildcard rule only after testing in Test_Data. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Reconciliations (register and procedures)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Automated and manual reconciliation worksheets proving the AccrualRegister ties to AP ledger and the consolidated TB, with variance drill paths and reconciliation sign-off. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> ReconID, EntityID, Period, SourceTotal, MappedTotal, Difference, Status, Owner, LastUpdated, Notes, SupportingRefs. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Power Query extracts entity GL totals and maps via Mappings_COA to group accounts then compares to AccrualRegister sums. Manual adjustments recorded with JE references. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Differences above Materiality flagged; recon status required (Reconciled/Exception/Pending). <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Controllers run recon, identify top differences, drill to source lines using hyperlinks, and resolve via journal or mapping fix. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Consolidation Accountant. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Reconciliation proves that accruals in the register equal amounts in the ledger. If not, fix source or post correcting journal and re-run. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Provide a triage matrix to decide whether to correct immediately or document as timing difference. Keep top-10 differences report with drill-to links for auditors. Add a sign-off table capturing preparer and reviewer and store snapshots in Archive at close. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If recon shows periodic persistent 500 difference per entity, investigate rounding rules or FX rate mismatch; compare FXRateUsed in AccrualRegister to FX_Rates for the period. If mapping error found (wrong GroupAccount), add mapping change with effective date and document impact. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Reports_Output (month-end packaging & disclosure)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Generate final deliverables: accrual schedules by donor/project, supporting notes for auditors, journal export files for ERP, and consolidated disclosures for financial statements. <br><strong>Key fields / outputs</strong><br> Accrual schedule (detailed), Top exceptions summary, Reconciliation pack, Export CSV for ERP (export filename + mapping), Audit evidence bundle list, Management commentary. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Auto-generated from AccrualRegister, Reconciliations and Exceptions; user may add narrative text blocks and attach supporting docs. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Ensure export file matches ERP import spec (column order, field types). Check that all material accrual narrative paragraphs present. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Prepare final pack, attach signed approval evidence, create Archive snapshot, export CSV for ledger import. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Reporting / Controller. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> This is the “final” sheet used to create the month-end pack and upload approved journals to the ERP. Confirm approvals and run final checks before exporting. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Provide standardized cover page template and table of contents that auto-populates with key metrics and attachments. Include an “Export dry-run” button that validates CSV file against ERP field rules (length, mandatory columns). Keep an ExportLog table capturing who exported what and ERP response codes. For auditors, provide zipped evidence bundle with RequestIDs and checksums. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If ERP rejects import due to unknown cost center, use ExportLog to find offending line, correct mapping in Mappings_COA and re-export. Maintain a sandbox ERP instance for dry runs when structural changes implemented. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Audit_Log (immutable change history)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Append-only log capturing changes to critical configuration, approvals, FX overrides, posting actions and any manual journal changes for forensic trail and auditor review. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> LogID, Table/Sheet, RecordKey, FieldName, OldValue, NewValue, ChangedBy, ChangedAt, ChangeReason, EvidenceLink. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Via macros, Power Query append steps or API hooks that record every configuration or journal change. Controls enforce append-only and restrict delete by file protection/permissions. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> No null ChangedBy or ChangedAt; ChangeReason required for overrides. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Use for audit queries, to reconstruct who changed what and when. Ensure ChangeReason is descriptive. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Audit / Controller. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> This is your forensic record. Never edit or delete log rows; create corrective rows for changes instead. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Provide quick filters: last 30 days, mapping changes, FX overrides, posting reversals. Create automated monthly summary of high-risk changes (e.g., frequent mapping churn) and route to Audit. For secure environments, export periodic snapshots and store in WORM or secure archive with checksums. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If auditors request mapping history for SourceAccount 1234, filter Audit_Log for mapping table entries and export with related RequestIDs. If suspicious pattern found (same user overriding FX rates often), escalate to IT for permissions review and require dual-approval for FX overrides. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Test_Data & QA (sandbox)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Safe sandbox for testing mapping changes, wildcard rules, elimination tuning and Power Query M-code edits using representative test cases before deploying to production. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> TestCaseID, Description, InputFiles, ExpectedOutcome, TestStatus (NotRun/Passed/Failed), ExecutedBy, ExecDate, Notes. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Managed by QA/ETL developers; copies of sample accruals, invoices, FX scenarios and prior problem cases included. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Test coverage matrix and regression suite passing requirement before promoting changes. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Run regression suite after mapping or rule changes and document results here. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> QA / ETL Developer. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Use this sheet to safely trial rule changes; never modify production sheets directly from here. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Keep a small but representative dataset including edge cases (currency missing, multi-donor split, unusually large amounts). Automate minimal tests (ingest → map → convert → consolidate) and capture output snapshots. Maintain a test-change log with M-code diffs and results. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> Before enabling a wildcard mapping rule that previously caused false positives, run a targeted test-case that replicates the false-positive scenario and confirm new parameters fix it. If a test fails unexpectedly after a mapping change, revert mapping in Test_Data, diagnose, and record resolve steps. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>PowerQuery_Staging (queries & data model notes)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Hidden/query-only tables that manage Power Query steps, M-code snippets, dependency map and notes on query folding, performance and transformations used to produce AccrualRegister view. <br><strong>Key fields / contents</strong><br> QueryName, SourcePath, LastRefreshDuration, M_CodeSnippet, UpstreamDependencies, FoldingAllowedFlag, Notes. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Maintained by ETL/Power Query developer; M-code snippets embedded for versioning; dependency map updated when queries changed. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Query names unique; source paths reachable; key transformation steps commented. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> ETL developers edit M-code here and then publish changes after testing in Test_Data. Controllers read Notes for impact. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> ETL Developer. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Power Query does the heavy lifting; avoid editing M-code unless you can test in Test_Data. Document every change. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Keep a query dependency diagram on this sheet, annotate folding-breakers and recommended optimisations such as applying filters early to enable folding. Store M-code versions (exported text) for version control and maintain changelog entries detailing why a change occurred and performance impact observed. Provide a small troubleshooting checklist for slow queries (check source network, evaluate Table.Buffer usage, move heavy joins to database). <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If refresh time spikes after a change, use LastRefreshDuration to isolate slow query; check for new steps that disable folding (Table.Buffer, custom functions). Revert to prior M-code from version history if needed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>PowerBI_Export (semantic layer & exports)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Parameters and table selection details used when publishing to Power BI — ensures report dataset parameters (Period, ReportingCurrency) are synchronized with the workbook control settings and documents PBIX paths and last publish times. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> DatasetName, PBIX_Path, TablesIncluded, LastPublish, DatasetParameters (Period, Currency), IncrementalRefreshToken, Owner, Notes. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Manually by BI Developer during publish; parameter snapshots captured to ensure reproducibility. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> DatasetParameters must match Control sheet values for published period; TablesIncluded must include AccrualRegister and Consolidated_TB. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> BI Developer updates before publishing; report authors ensure visuals align with model fields. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> BI Developer. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Ensure the workbook period selector and published dataset parameter are aligned to avoid mismatched visuals. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Keep PBIX version naming convention; include publish notes and dataset ID for traceability. Run a smoke test after publish verifying top visuals and data freshness. For incremental refresh ensure partitions align to Period field. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If Power BI shows older data, check LastPublish and dataset parameters; republish PBIX after verifying PowerQuery refresh completes successfully. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Reports_Template_Library (templates & sample narratives)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Store standardized report templates, narrative boilerplates for accrual disclosures, sample audit notes and cover pages to speed pack production and ensure consistent messaging. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> TemplateID, TemplateName, FilePath, UseCase, LastUpdated, Owner, Notes. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Maintained by Reporting with approved language for material accrual explanations and donor-specific disclosure templates. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> All templates must include placeholders for RequestIDs, JE refs and links to supporting files; last-updated and owner information mandatory. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Use templates to populate Reports_Output; update versions when policy changes. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Reporting. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Use approved templates to avoid last-minute freehand text and ensure audit-ready packs. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If auditors request a specific wording, use template v2.1 stored here and attach mapping change logs. Keep version history for legal review. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Archive (read-only snapshots)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Immutable period snapshots of AccrualRegister, supporting evidence lists and Reports_Output retained for audit and comparability (WORM-like behavior recommended). <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> SnapshotID, Period, SnapshotDate, FileRefs, ManifestChecksum, ArchiveLocation, RetentionExpiry. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Created at close sign-off; automated macro zips relevant sheets/documents and records checksums. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Checksum verification on write; SnapshotDate = close sign-off date; read-only permissions. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Retrieve prior-period snapshots for audit queries; use manifests to prove immutability. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Records / IT. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Snapshots are frozen views of what was reported at close. Don't modify; if you need historic data, extract from Archive rather than re-run with changed mappings. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Store manifest including mapping versions, FX rates used, and runbook note for that close. Keep a short “what changed vs prior snapshot” summary to help auditors understand adjustments or restatements. Consider moving older snapshots to colder storage with retrieval SLA documented. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If auditors challenge a prior-period mapping, provide Snapshot manifest with Mapping_Change_Log and Audit_Log entries to demonstrate rationale and timing. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Runbook_Readme (procedures & contacts)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Operational runbook: step-by-step close checklist, troubleshooting steps for common failures, escalation contacts and links to training materials and templates. <br><strong>Key fields / contents</strong><br> Close checklist, contact matrix (name/email/backup), top-10 troubleshooting flows, links to key sheets, training video links, change log of runbook edits. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Maintained by Process Lead; updated after each close with learnings and post-mortem notes. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Contact list up-to-date periodically (quarterly) and last-updated timestamp visible. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Follow runbook daily during close; consult troubleshooting flows before escalating to IT. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> Process Lead. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Read this first when you join the close team; it contains the checklists and who to call for common issues. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Provide simulated “rehearsal” scripts for new starters and a short “if X then do Y” table for top 8 failures (e.g., missing uploads, FX feed failure, mapping drift). Add runbook sign-off and update history. Include links to critical templates (AccrualRequests template, AccrualsTracker) and sample emails for chasing missing docs. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> Example run: missing FX feed — run steps: check Treasury feed credentials → fallback to manual FX input in FX_Rates → log override in Audit_Log and notify Controller. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Security_Settings (roles and masks)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Define sheet-level permissions, masked fields (PII), role definitions and emergency access procedures. <br><strong>Key fields</strong><br> RoleName, PermissionsList (View/Edit/Approve), MaskingRules (columns masked), AdminContact, DelegationRules. <br><strong>Populated</strong><br> Maintained by IT Security and Controller. <br><strong>Validations</strong><br> Ensure at least one Admin and at least one backup for roles; masking rules enforced by macros or workbook protection. <br><strong>User action</strong><br> Request access via the documented access request flow; approvers verify DoA before granting. <br><strong>Owner</strong><br> IT Security / Controller. <br><strong>Beginner explanation</strong><br> Some sensitive fields are masked by default (vendor bank details); request temporary access only when needed and approvals are recorded in Audit_Log. <br><strong>Detailed narrative & practical tips</strong><br> Implement periodic access reviews, dual-control for FX overrides and mapping changes, and logging of temporary elevated access. For auditors, use temporary auditor access with read-only view and an expiry timestamp. <br><strong>Practical examples & troubleshooting</strong><br> If a user reports missing sheet access, check Security_Settings and membership in the appropriate AD/SSO group. For emergency auditor access, follow documented temporary access process and record in Audit_Log. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Guidance per sheet (top-left instruction block)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Every sheet should have a mini-instruction card: purpose, quick actions, owner contact and known issues. <br><strong>Contents</strong><br> Purpose summary, Quick Actions (3 items), Who to contact, Known issues, Last updated timestamp, Link to Runbook_Readme. <br><strong>Practical tip</strong><br> Keep the instruction block short and consistent across sheets to reduce onboarding friction; include a “What to check after refresh” checklist (row count, sample lines, top 5 amounts). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Accruals Workbook — Sheet-by-sheet explanation"> <strong>Testing & QA (acceptance & regression)</strong><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br>Define acceptance criteria for any change (mapping rules, wildcard patterns, FX overrides) and the regression tests to run before deploying to production. <br><strong>Key contents</strong><br> Test suite list, test case owners, pass/fail criteria, baseline outputs. <br><strong>Practical tip</strong><br> Require at least one smoke test (ingest → map → convert → consolidate) and a regression run on a small but representative dataset for every production change.
