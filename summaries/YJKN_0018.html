Its objectives are: reduce repetitive funder due-diligence by creating a common evidence standard; raise the consistency and reliability of organisational financial, HR, procurement and governance controls; and create a verifiable pathway to independent certification demonstrating continuous improvement. The Standard emphasises proportionality: expectation and evidence should reflect organisation size, funding complexity, legal environment and operational risk. Evidence must show both the existence of policy and the consistent, historical application of the policy via transactional samples and management oversight. Certification is an outcome of sustained practice — not a one-off documentation exercise.<br><strong>Operational aim & intent:</strong> Convert policies into repeatable processes with named owners, tracked remediation, automation where feasible, and evidence in a central repository mapped to RequirementIDs. Produce: documented controls, searchable evidence, demonstrable implementation, and a continuous improvement loop that reduces time-to-contract with funders. The organisation must demonstrate policy → SOP → transaction sample → remediation trace for each significant control.<br><strong>Success metrics (practical, measurable):</strong><br>• Portal acceptance: funders accept portal pre-certification in lieu of repetitive evidence.<br>• Control performance: internal audit sample findings < 2% control failures across sampled transactions.<br>• Retrieval SLA: evidence retrieval SLA met >95% within 3 working days.<br>• Operational integration: GL narratives include PayrollRun ID on 100% of payroll journals.<br><strong>Decision triggers & policy application examples:</strong><br>• Use GFGP portal tier as procurement criteria for sub-award partners (minimum Bronze for partners managing >USD 250k p.a.).<br>• Use remediation closure rate > 60 days as trigger for escalation to Executive sponsor. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Scope — inclusive boundaries, exclusions, in-scope activities and operational notes</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Scope covers organisation-level systems, policies and operating practices across four practice areas: Financial Management (budgeting, chart of accounts, GL mapping, bank and cash controls, reconciliations, payroll), Human Resources (contracts, payroll, classification, staff records), Procurement (tendering, evaluation, supplier due-diligence), and Governance (DoA, board oversight, fraud policy, whistleblowing). Cross-cutting requirements include IT security, data protection, records management and continuity planning. GFGP applies to the full grant lifecycle: award set-up, budget allocation, accounting, payments, procurement for grant activities, payroll apportionment, donor reporting, closeout and archiving.<br><strong>Operational boundaries & exclusions:</strong> Explicitly document scope boundaries to prevent audit surprises. State which entities, cost centres and bank accounts are included; list excluded subsidiaries or non-grant commercial units and explain data segregation measures. For multi-country entities, define which country offices are "in-scope" for each certification attempt.<br><strong>In-scope examples:</strong> country offices receiving direct grants or allocating >10% of central payroll cost; central finance functions for grant accounting; outsourced payroll providers performing payroll for in-scope entities.<br><strong>Out-of-scope examples:</strong> wholly-owned commercial subsidiaries with separate audited accounts; non-grant commercial activities that do not affect donor funds.<br><strong>Scoped activities (concrete examples):</strong> award budget coding; salary apportionment and effort reporting; procurement for capital equipment; vendor monthly remittance proofs; inter-company cost reallocations for centrally managed payroll; GL mapping for donor budget lines. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Key definitions & core recognition principle — glossary, metadata & evidence taxonomy</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Use consistent definitions inside policies and evidence to avoid ambiguity during audits and portal tagging. Maintain a controlled-vocabulary definitional annex in the Evidence Repository. Primary concepts to define and use consistently: Evidence Index (master register mapping documents to RequirementIDs), Pre-certification (portal self-assessment output), Certification Audit (independent audit by licensed body), Compensating Controls, PayrollRun ID (unique identifier for each payroll run), Apportionment Schedule, Sample Transaction, Remediation Item.<br><strong>Metadata requirement for each Evidence Item:</strong> captured_date; owner; sample_period_start; sample_period_end; redaction_flag (Y/N); version; file_hash; evidence_type (Policy/SOP/TransactionSample/SystemLog/Certificate); RequirementIDs (one or more).<br><strong>Recognition principle:</strong> Treatment is judged by application over time; a policy without supporting transactional samples and sign-offs is insufficient. Accrual accounting is mandatory where applicable — expenses recognised when services were rendered rather than when cash flows occur. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Core principles & Key controls (GFGP alignment) — objectives, control activities, acceptance criteria, test plans</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Controls must be documented, ownership assigned, tested regularly and tracked in an Evidence Index. Controls include policies, segregation of duties & DoA, documented accounting & apportionment rules, monthly reconciliations and variance investigation, payroll control pack standards, supplier due-diligence for procurement, secure system controls and access review, DPIAs, audited backups and restore tests, internal audit cycle. Each control must have objective, control activity, acceptance criteria, and test steps documented in a Control Testing Matrix.<br><strong>Example control: Payroll authorisation</strong><br>• Objective: Ensure payroll amounts are authorised and accurate.<br>• Control activity: Independent reviewer signature and variance analysis on payroll control sheet.<br>• Acceptance criteria: Reviewer signature present; variance within threshold (default 2%) with explanation for anomalies; sample cross-check of 10 employees including top 2 earners.<br>• Test steps: Select 6 recent payroll runs; verify reviewer signature; recalc 10 sample employees; confirm GL narration includes PayrollRun ID; confirm bank advice equals net pay total.<br><strong>Additional examples of key controls in practice:</strong><br>• Procurement: retain evaluation matrices, conflict-of-interest declarations, award approvals and signed contracts in a single procurement file per contract.<br>• Bank reconciliations: monthly reconciliations with sign-off, evidence of review notes and issue tracking. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Governance & responsibilities (RACI mapping, governance packets, escalation traces)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> RACI clarity prevents evidential gaps. Document named responsible owners and deputies for each RequirementID and maintain ownership records. Governance should include escalation routes for unresolved remediation and policy exceptions. The Board/Executive must receive periodic summaries of GFGP readiness metrics and open remediation items.<br><strong>Detailed RACI (payroll example):</strong><br>• Responsible: Payroll Preparer (name/title).<br>• Accountable: CFO/Head of Finance.<br>• Consulted: HR Lead, IT System Owner.<br>• Informed: Budget Holders, Country Director.<br><strong>Governance artifacts to prepare & link to evidence:</strong> Board minutes approving GFGP programme; quarterly management dashboards showing % requirement coverage; remediation register with owner, due date, status, supporting evidence link; governance packet for major decisions (one-page summary + risk assessment + decision + follow-up tasks).<br><strong>Escalation rules example:</strong> unresolved remediation >30 days escalate to CFO; unresolved >60 days escalate to Executive sponsor with Board notification. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Systems & security (evidence focus, DPA/SOC, step-by-step checklist)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Systems are authoritative sources: ERP/GL, HRIS/HROS, payroll system (in-house or outsourced), procurement platforms, document repositories. Evidence should show role-based authorisations, quarterly access recertification, change control logs, backup/restore test results, independent provider attestations (SOC1/SOC2), encryption at rest/in transit, MFA for privileged accounts, logging and periodic log review, DPAs for third-party processors.<br><strong>Minimum systems evidence checklist:</strong> system inventory (owner; hosted location), role matrix & entitlement extract, quarterly access certification evidence signed by owners, backup schedule & last successful restore test report with RTO/RPO evidence, penetration test summary & remediation log, DPAs and SOC reports for SaaS providers, encryption statements and key management evidence, recent configuration change control log.<br><strong>Examples & documentation:</strong> Access review spreadsheet; backup restore test report; DPA and SOC2 for payroll vendor; audit trail samples for user access; MFA enablement evidence for admin accounts. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>GFGP adoption pathway (project governance, sprint model, stepwise plan & deliverables)</strong><br><strong>Narrative & pragmatic steps:</strong><br>1. Acquire/confirm ARS 1651/Standard summary and produce internal mapping to local rules.<br>2. Register organisation on GFGP portal; assign portal owner.<br>3. Run portal self-assessment; export gap report.<br>4. Create Evidence Index; tag existing documents; define metadata standard.<br>5. Prioritise remediation into Immediate / Medium / Long; define acceptance criteria for each remediation.<br>6. Assign owners; allocate resource / FTE estimates.<br>7. Implement quick wins (policies, reconciliations, sample packs).<br>8. Run internal readiness review/mock audit.<br>9. Engage licensed Certification Body; confirm sample sizes & scope.<br>10. Address non-conformances; document closure evidence. Maintain cadence for ongoing self-assessment.<br><strong>Sprint model example (2-week sprint):</strong> Sprint planning: identify N RequirementIDs and owners; Execution: owners collect files, apply naming convention & tag Evidence Index; Review: internal reviewer runs checklist; create remediation tickets for unresolved items; Demo: portal owner shows completed packs & remediation status; Retrospective: feedback loop to improve next sprint. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Portal & pre-certification outputs (what to expect, storage & handling large files)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Portal typically returns: quantified coverage % by practice area & RequirementID; ranked gap list; suggested remediation tasks; templates; tier recommendation (Bronze->Platinum). Save portal reports (PDF/CSV) in Evidence Repository with unique filename and evidence entry.<br><strong>Handling large attachments:</strong> For attachments >10MB compress into zipped packs and include manifest (file list + SHA256 hashes + index). Store zipped pack in archive and upload manifest to portal. Keep an unzipped index entry for quick search. Evidence Index should include pointer to zip and manifest.<br><strong>Naming example for portal outputs:</strong> <code>Portal_GapReport_OrgName_YYYYMMDD.pdf</code> → link to Evidence Index row with metadata and owner. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Certification pathway & practicalities (audit engagement checklist & pre-audit prep)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Certification requires evidence of consistent practice; may include remote documentation review plus targeted site visits. Select a licensed Certification Body early for scope and fee estimate. Prepare transactional sample sets (3–12 months) per practice area. Anticipate corrective action plans and budget for re-assessment cycles per certification validity.<br><strong>Pre-audit checklist:</strong> confirm audit scope and sample sizes with cert body; pre-assemble audit packs & cross-reference indexes; prepare named auditor liaison and calendar slots; ensure secure shared folder or portal access; have NDA and secure channel for unredacted files.<br><strong>During audit:</strong> Provide daily status notes summarising files provided & open queries. Record all auditor requests and responses in query tracker. Provide a short "how to navigate pack" guide.<br><strong>Post audit:</strong> prepare corrective action plan with owners/due dates; update remediation register and Evidence Index with closure evidence; produce executive summary for Board. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Evidence catalogue — minimum evidence types, mapping rules, sample lists by practice area</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> For each practice area produce a package: signed policy (with version history); SOP & process map; evidence of application (3–12 months representative transactions); reconciliations & variance analysis; authorisation approvals (DoA/email/portal approvals with audit trail); system logs; training records; internal audit results. Tag each document with RequirementID(s) and provide short comment on relevance. For donor-funded activities include donor compliance evidence (timesheets, apportionment schedules).<br><strong>Mapping rules:</strong> one file may map to multiple RequirementIDs — include explanatory note per mapping. For sampled bundles include cover sheet listing which records map to which RequirementID. Use controlled vocabulary for EvidenceType: Policy/SOP/TransactionSample/SystemLog/Certificate/Remediation.<br><strong>Detailed sample evidence lists by practice area:</strong><br>• Finance: chart of accounts mapping; bank reconciliations (3 months); treasury signatory list; petty cash logs; GL upload preview & posted journal with PayrollRun ID; sample invoices + POs + payment approvals.<br>• HR/Payroll: staff contracts; HROS master extract; payroll control pack for last 6 runs; payslips (redacted where necessary); statutory remittance receipts; joiner/leaver checklist; payroll reconciliation and variance analysis.<br>• Procurement: procurement policy; supplier register; 3 sample tender files (advert, evaluation, award approval, contract); conflict-of-interest declarations; supplier due-diligence docs.<br>• Governance: DoA; Board minutes approving key policies; fraud policy + whistleblowing logs; internal audit reports + remediation logs. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Document & evidence management (naming, storage, retention, folder structure & automation)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Centralise evidence in an access-controlled repository with version control and searchable index. Maintain master Evidence Index with columns: RequirementID, PracticeArea, DocumentName, FilePath/URL, Owner, DateCollected, SamplePeriodStart, SamplePeriodEnd, Version, RedactionRequired (Y/N), Notes, FileHash. Automate exportable views for auditors (pack per practice area). Implement retention metadata per local law & donor rules. Ensure PDFs are OCR/searchable; for scanned images, include OCR pass and metadata. Provide cross-reference sheet for zipped archives.<br><strong>Strict naming convention (enforce by pre-upload validation):</strong> <code>&lt;GFGP&gt;_&lt;PracticeArea&gt;_&lt;DocType&gt;_&lt;PayrollRunID_or_Period&gt;_&lt;YYYYMMDD&gt;_&lt;ShortID&gt;_&lt;v#&gt;.pdf</code>.<br><strong>Suggested folder structure:</strong> <code>/evidence/{practice_area}/{year}/{doc_type}/</code> e.g., <code>/evidence/payroll/2026/control_packs/</code> with index CSV per folder.<br><strong>Retention matrix (example):</strong> payroll transactions 7 years (or local statute); board minutes permanent; procurement capital files 10 years; system logs 1-3 years depending on policy. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Sample control checklists (detailed), pre-upload validation rules & checklist automation</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Prepare checklists per practice area that evidence owners must complete before document presentation. Each checklist signed by owner and date-stamped. Use automated validation to catch naming & metadata errors before upload.<br><strong>Payroll control checklist (detailed):</strong><br>1. Master data extract included & reconciled.<br>2. Payroll control sheet with preparer signature (digital or scan) & timestamp.<br>3. Reviewer signature & variance analysis attached.<br>4.

Provide a small pseudo-code validator (below).</td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Implementation & remediation project plan (priorities, escalation, Gantt text & sprint backlog examples)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Structure as three horizons: Immediate (0–3 months), Medium (3–9 months), Long (9–18 months). Maintain remediation register updated weekly. Use agile sprints (2–4 weeks) for evidence collection with sprint owner and deliverables. Include contingency for external dependencies (vendor SOC reports).<br><strong>Escalation matrix (severity & SLA):</strong><br>• Sev1 — Critical (material financial risk): escalate to Board within 48 hours; emergency remediation plan; daily status until closed.<br>• Sev2 — High (donor impact): escalate to Executive sponsor within 7 days; weekly updates.<br>• Sev3 — Medium/Low: logged in remediation register; standard cadence.<br><strong>Sample sprint backlog items (example 2-week sprint):</strong> gather last 3 payroll packs; upload bank reconciliations for Q4; create evidence index entries + file hashes for 20 files; run OCR on scanned policy docs; finalize DoA updates; fix 10 filename errors flagged by validator.<br><strong>Textual Gantt (summary):</strong> 0–3 months: Portal registration, Evidence Index creation, 3-month sample packs, publish core policies. 3–6 months: Staff training, collect 12 months sample, implement validation rules, internal audits. 6–12 months: Systems integration planning, mock certification audit, remediation closure. 12–18 months: Certification audit, address non-conformances, implement sustained evidence refresh cadence. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Costs & timeline benchmarks (detailed planning, vendor selection & cost estimation guidance)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Costs/timelines vary by starting maturity. Budget lines: portal fees, training & consultancy, internal staff time for evidence collation, IT integration, certification audit fees. Provide at least two vendor quotes. Plan for internal FTE allocation and contingency.<br><strong>Indicative planning table (illustrative):</strong><br>• Small NGO (well-prepared): 3–6 months readiness; internal effort 0.1–0.2 FTE for 3 months; consultant optional; audit fees low ($1k-$5k).<br>• Medium research institute: 6–9 months; internal effort 0.2–0.5 FTE; consultant $3k–$12k; audit fees $5k–$15k.<br>• Large org: 9–18 months; internal project team 0.5–2.0 FTE; IT integration higher; audit fees scale with transaction volume.<br><strong>Cost drivers:</strong> audit scope (#entities, transactions), on-site days, manual vs integrated systems, day rates. Always request SOW with deliverables, timelines, remote/on-site split, sample sizes, and hourly/day rates. Retain contingency (10–20%) for unexpected rework. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Common pitfalls & mitigations — practical enforcement & quick pre-audit checklist</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Common pitfalls: poor indexing, inconsistent naming, incomplete or improperly redacted samples without cross-references, inadequate segregation of duties, insufficient transactional history, underestimation of staff time for evidence collation. Mitigations: strict naming convention, enforcement via pre-upload validator, scheduled sample collection drives, documented compensating controls where segregation not possible, mock audits, executive sponsorship to unblock resources.<br><strong>Concrete mitigations & tools:</strong><br>• Enforce folder templates & pre-upload validation.<br>• Run monthly sample collection drives with owner reminders and measured KPIs.<br>• Use automated scripts to flag missing metadata & name anomalies.<br>• Implement compensating control templates for small offices and include test plans.<br><strong>Quick pre-audit checklist:</strong> Filename consistency; Evidence Index entries complete & owners assigned; Sample bundles include signed approvals; Redaction log present for PII; At least one mock auditor submission completed & peer-reviewed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Mapping to award management & donor due diligence — donor mapping, template & reuse</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Create donor-mapping table linking frequent donor evidence requests to RequirementIDs and organisation evidence. Use GFGP certification/pre-certification to negotiate reduced due diligence. Maintain donor-specific appendices for deviations from GFGP.<br><strong>Donor mapping table fields:</strong> <code>DonorName | DonorRequestPhrase | GFGP_ReqID | OrgEvidenceRef | Comments | LastUpdated</code>. Example row: <code>DFID | Last 6 months bank recon | GFGP_REQ_FM_02 | /evidence/bank/recon_202601.pdf | Provided via portal pack | 2026-02-16</code>.<br><strong>Practical use:</strong> Auto-generate donor response packs by filtering Evidence Index by RequirementIDs mapped to donor requests, and produce zipped audit packs with manifest & cross-ref matrix. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Monitoring, re-assessment & sustaining compliance — lifecycle, cadence & owner attestations</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Maintain an annual compliance cycle: portal self-assessment, internal audit, remediation, management review and Board update. Schedule quarterly owner attestations; maintain rolling evidence refresh schedule (e.g., update sample packs quarterly). Track remediation via live register and escalate long-running items. Use KPIs to monitor progress and business case for resources.<br><strong>Suggested cadence example:</strong> Jan portal self-assessment; Feb internal audit; Mar–May remediation sprints; Jun executive review; Sep update evidence packs; Nov Board update. Quarterly owner attestations for evidence completeness; annual mock audit; evidence refresh sprints each quarter; KPI reporting to Board twice yearly. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>KPIs & management reporting (definitions, calculation, dashboard examples)</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> KPIs should be measurable, time-bound and aligned to governance needs. Use dashboards with trend lines for progress and risk exposure.<br><strong>KPI definitions & targets (examples):</strong><br>• RequirementCoverage (%) = (Count ReqIDs with valid Evidence Items / Total ReqIDs) <em> 100. Target >75% pre-audit; >90% post-certification.<br>• EvidenceRetrievalSLA (%) = (# requests fulfilled within SLA / Total requests) </em> 100. Target >95%.<br>• RemediationClosureTime (median days) Target <45 days.<br>• SampleTestPassRate (%) Target >90%.<br>• CostToCompilePack (USD) = staff_hours * loaded_hourly_rate. Track and benchmark annually.<br><strong>Dashboard layout suggestions:</strong> KPI tickers (current vs target), trend charts (last 12 months), remediation open-by-age, top 10 missing RequirementIDs, evidence retrieval SLAs by owner, sample test pass rate over time. Include drill-down capabilities linking to Evidence Index rows. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Good Financial Grant Practice (GFGP)"> <strong>Training, roles & change management — curriculum, modules, role-specific materials & completion tracking</strong><br><strong>Narrative:</strong> Training must be role-specific and practical. Evidence owners get tag & redaction training; preparers/reviewers receive procedural training and tabletop mock audits. Document role responsibilities and include GFGP tasks in annual objectives. Change management should include stakeholder comms, training, and quick reference guides.<br><strong>Suggested training plan & micro-modules:</strong> Week 1 portal orientation for leadership; Week 2 evidence index hands-on for owners; Week 3 payroll/HR workshop; Week 6 procurement file walkthrough; Week 12 mock audit exercise. Micro-modules (30–60 mins) include: Evidence Index basics & tagging; Redaction & PII rules; Payroll pack assembly; Procurement file build & evaluation scoring.
