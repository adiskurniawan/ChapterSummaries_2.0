The chapter concludes that recognizing the mundane, cumulative nature of excellence and changing selection and support systems accordingly will yield better long-term outcomes. Effort and structured practice deserve equal standing with momentary displays of ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 9</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table3" data-table="Book_0008_03" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Chapter 3 — Effort Counts Twice</strong></div>

High demands without authentic support can create coercion, shame, or burnout. Cultural and developmental differences change how children interpret demands and care. Some vulnerable individuals require more explicit emotional scaffolding before standards can be productive. The chapter calls for calibrated application of tough expectations and monitoring for adverse effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Section"><strong>Research gaps and measurement priorities</strong>  </td><td data-label="Summary">The chapter identifies open questions and recommends measurement strategies. <br>1.
