Indonesian labour law and accounting standards support employer obligations for termination payments and treat some termination benefits as obligations that may require recognition earlier than cash payment. The arrangement can be defensible if carefully designed, documented, and governed. But it must be stress-tested against three vectors: (A) employment law (conversion/continuous employment and third-party employer risk), (B) accounting and audit standards (timing and disclosure), and (C) grant/donor compliance (allowability, budget control, and auditability). Below are the key analyses and mitigations. <br><br> <strong>A. Legal risk: employment status, fixed-term contracts and third-party arrangements</strong><br>• Indonesian law requires termination compensation (uang pesangon, uang penghargaan masa kerja, uang penggantian hak) when employment ends under certain conditions. These rights exist for both indefinite and specified-term workers. <br>• PKWT (fixed-term) contracts are lawful for specific tasks but subject to strict formal rules. Multiple renewals or continuous renewals may cause reclassification to PKWTT (permanent), triggering back pay and protections. <br>• If OUCRU effectively controls work and supervision, authorities may treat OUCRU and AA as joint employers. Substantive control outweighs contractual form. <br>• The Job Creation Law (UU 11/2020) and Government Regulation No. 35/2021 revised benefit calculation rules. Outdated methods risk non-compliance. <br><strong>Legal takeaway:</strong> the one-year PKWT through AA reduces exposure only if (a) the PKWT is objectively justified and not renewed to create permanence, (b) OUCRU’s control remains limited, and (c) AA acts as a genuine independent employer with HR capacity and liability. <br><br> <strong>B. Accounting and audit risk: timing of recognition and disclosure</strong><br>• Indonesian PSAK mirrors IAS 19. Termination benefits are recognised when a demonstrable commitment or constructive obligation exists. <br>• Recognising payments only upon cash settlement is acceptable only when no present obligation exists before contract end. If benefits are routinely paid at each renewal, auditors may require accrual. <br>• Donor accounting requires costs to be recognised when incurred. Cash-only recognition can create timing mismatches and questioned costs. <br><strong>Accounting takeaway:</strong> the practice is defensible only with written policy, legal and audit support confirming no present obligation. Otherwise auditors may demand accrual or disclosure. <br><br> <strong>C. Grant, compliance and practical controls</strong><br>• Donor rules require costs to be reasonable, allocable, and consistent. Large termination payments at project end may be disallowed if unbudgeted. <br>• Maintain written PKWTs, evidence of AA’s independent HR role, OUCRU-AA agreements defining liability, and a register of renewals and justifications. <br>• Limit renewals; where continuity is essential, consider permanent employment with full statutory cost budgeting. Ensure AA has financial capacity and insurance for liabilities. <br><br> <strong>D. Specific recommended actions (high leverage)</strong><br>1. Obtain legal opinion on structure, control, and exposure under GR 35/2021. <br>2. Obtain auditor or accounting-advisor opinion on PSAK/IAS 19 recognition requirements. <br>3. Strengthen PKWT drafting and ensure AA exercises HR control and maintains indemnity coverage. <br>4. Document accounting policy and, if using cash basis, include clear disclosure and contingent-liability register. <br>5. Pre-audit grant budgets, forecast termination costs, and document inter-project transfers for auditability. <br><br> <strong>E. Practical numeric checks</strong><br>• Produce a renewal history table for each staff member (start date, end date, renewals, role changes). <br>• Compute statutory termination entitlement under current regulation (pesangon + penghargaan + penggantian hak) to estimate worst-case liability. <br>• Reconcile payroll, tax, and BPJS filings showing AA as employer. Keep proof of payments and filings. <br><br> <strong>Conclusion and decision points</strong><br>Continue the current approach only if: (1) AA is a genuine independent employer; (2) PKWT use is legally justified; (3) legal and audit opinions support cash recognition; and (4) indemnities and reserves are robust. <br>If any condition fails, move to accrual recognition, strengthen indemnities, or convert to permanent employment with full statutory cost planning. <br><strong>Immediate next steps:</strong> commission legal and accounting opinions and prepare the renewal/liability table for board review. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 1</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table2" data-table="Docu_0062_02" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Table 2</strong></div>

K.2 Include retention schedules and specified formats for payroll and time allocation records.<br><br><strong>DRAFTING NOTES, RISK MITIGATIONS & PRACTICAL CONTROLS (IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST)</strong><br>1. <strong>Separation of Powers</strong>. Implement written SOP describing what constitutes <code>employment control</code>. Train OUCRU managers to avoid actions that may be treated as employer actions (salary decisions, hiring, firing, formal warnings). Keep examples. Use an internal escalation path where HR matters are referred to AA HR. <br>2. <strong>Document Objective Justification</strong>. For each PKWT include a 1–2 paragraph commercial justification explaining why role is project/temporary and not core. Save contemporaneous evidence (project charters, funding period). <br>3. <strong>Registration Proof</strong>. Save screenshots/PDFs of Ministry PKWT registration and BPJS/tax payment receipts in a per-employee folder. <br>4. <strong>Renewal Protocol</strong>. When extension is needed, create a short written <code>extension memo</code> recording changed deliverables, funding source, start/end dates, and justification. Execute a new PKWT rather than amend silently. <br>5. <strong>Aggregate Term Tracking</strong>. Maintain a register showing start dates, prior renewals, total aggregate time against GR 35/2021 limits. Flag staff approaching thresholds. <br>6. <strong>Operational Separation Evidence</strong>. Keep copies of OUCRU’s written performance feedback memos and AA’s employment actions (warnings, salary adjustments) showing AA made HR decisions. <br>7. <strong>Insurance & Indemnity</strong>. Require AA to maintain employer liability insurance with minimum limits. If possible, get AA’s insurer to confirm coverage for claims arising from supply to OUCRU. <br>8. <strong>Accounting & Audit Preparedness</strong>. Insert a contractual obligation on AA to supply quarterly payroll reconciliations and end-of-term payment schedules formatted for donor audits. Agree on cost-allocation keys for multi-project staff. <br>9. <strong>Communication Templates</strong>. Prepare standard wording for job adverts, offer letters, performance memos and termination letters that emphasise AA as employer. Use <code>AA</code> letterhead for HR documents. <br>10. <strong>Empower HR Oversight</strong>. AA should run induction, payroll, tax/BPJS filings and disciplinary processes. AA must document decisions and outcomes in employee HR file. <br><br><strong>ADDITIONAL CLAUSE SAMPLES (SHORT, ADAPTABLE WORDING)</strong><br><strong>Sample anti-joint-employer clause:</strong> “The Parties agree that nothing in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between OUCRU and any Staff. Each Party shall act within its allocated role and shall not purport to exercise the other Party’s employer functions.”<br><br><strong>Sample audit cooperation clause:</strong> “AA shall, on reasonable notice and at OUCRU’s cost where required by donor terms, provide copies of payroll, BPJS and tax filings and originals of PKWTs for Staff supplied to OUCRU to enable donor audits. Sensitive personal data may be redacted but full financial records must be made available.”<br><br><strong>RISK MATRIX (HIGH-LEVERAGE ITEMS & CONTROLS)</strong><br>• <strong>Risk:</strong> Recharacterisation as PKWTT or joint employer. <strong>Control:</strong> Strict role separation, written proof AA made HR decisions, register of justifications, insurance and indemnities. <br>• <strong>Risk:</strong> Auditor requires accrual for termination benefits. <strong>Control:</strong> Obtain written external audit opinion, include sample statutory calculation in PKWT Schedule and maintain contingent liability register. <br>• <strong>Risk:</strong> Donor disallowance of end-of-term costs. <strong>Control:</strong> Pre-audit budgets, cost allocation templates, and timely documentation of staff transfers. <br><br><strong>IMPLEMENTATION TIMETABLE (RECOMMENDED FIRST 90 DAYS)</strong><br>Day 0–14: Legal review and Bahasa translation. <br>Day 7–30: Update master Service Agreement and PKWT templates. Train OUCRU managers on employer-control boundaries. <br>Day 14–45: Build PKWT register and import historic renewals. <br>Day 30–60: Obtain AA insurance certificate and indemnity confirmation. <br>Day 30–90: Commission legal opinion on reclassification risk and auditor opinion on accrual recognition under PSAK/IAS 19. <br><br><strong>DOCUMENTATION & AUDIT PACKAGE (DELIVERABLES TO KEEP)</strong><br>• Signed Service Agreement and Schedules.<br>• Employee PKWTs (originals).<br>• Ministry PKWT registration proofs.<br>• Payroll register, payslips, BPJS/tax receipts per employee.<br>• Renewal memos and justifications.<br>• Insurance certificate and indemnity clause evidence.<br>• Quarterly reconciliations and donor-ready audit packs.<br><br><strong>FINAL REMARKS</strong><br>These clauses and controls materially reduce legal, accounting and grant risks when correctly implemented together with operational discipline, insurance and external legal and auditor sign-off. Do not rely on form alone. Ensure Bahasa Indonesia primary contracts, contemporaneous project justifications, PKWT registration, robust recordkeeping, and enforceable indemnities and insurance. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 1</div></div><script src="assets/xlsx.full.min.js?v=1758605028" defer></script>
