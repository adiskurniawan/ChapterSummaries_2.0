Typical Trustee term: three years, renewable once; appointments by existing Trustees subject to Monitoring Board approval.<br>• Trustee selection criteria: collective balance of professional backgrounds (regulators, investors, auditors, preparers, users, academics), global experience, financial literacy and time commitment. Procedures exist to solicit nominations (consultation with public interest bodies).<br>• Trustee duties (selected, not exhaustive): appoint IASB/ISSB/IFRS IC/Advisory Council/ASAF members; appoint Executive Director (with Chairs’ consultation) and set performance criteria; review strategy annually for Foundation/IASB/ISSB (but not determine IASB technical agenda); establish/maintain financing arrangements and approve annual budget; establish/amend operating procedures and consultative arrangements; oversee due process and the DPOC; foster educational programmes; publish annual report and audited financials.<br>• Funding: mainly voluntary contributions (jurisdictions, seed funding for ISSB, philanthropic grants, firms including accounting firms); many jurisdictions use levies or public financing; earned revenue from licensing intellectual property; major 2022 funders included the European Commission, international accounting firms, Canada and Germany (per chapter). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.3 The Monitoring Board</strong><br>• Purpose: formal public-authority oversight link to Trustees, replicating national oversight relationships; preserve IASB/ISSB independence while reinforcing public interest oversight.<br>• Mission summary: promote IFRS accounting & sustainability disclosure standards; monitor/reinforce Foundation public oversight; participate in Trustee selection/approval; advise Trustees on regulatory/legal/policy matters and funding; discuss regulatory/market developments relevant to IFRS and ISSB work.<br>• Responsibilities: participate in Trustee appointment process and approve appointments; review/advise on Trustee performance (Trustees report annually); meet Trustees at least annually and may request additional meetings with Trustees or IASB/ISSB Chairs.<br>• Membership snapshot and criteria: membership drawn from major capital market authorities (examples given: IOSCO Board; IOSCO Growth & Emerging Markets Committee; Japan Financial Services Agency (chair); European Commission; US SEC; Brazil CVM; Korea Financial Services Commission; China Ministry of Finance; UK FCA; Basel Committee observer). Membership criteria include being a capital markets authority, commitment to IFRS adoption or convergence, market significance, enforcement capacity, funding contribution and national standard-setter engagement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.4 The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)</strong><br>• Membership & composition: Trustees appoint IASB members; IASB normally comprises 14 members (chapter reference) chosen for technical competence and diverse international business/market experience (auditors, preparers, users, academics, regulators). Expected geographic mix: 4 Asia/Oceania, 4 Europe, 4 Americas, 1 Africa, 1 any area (subject to balance). No individual should simultaneously be a Trustee and IASB member.<br>• Powers & responsibilities: full responsibility for IASB technical matters — prepare/issue IFRS accounting standards and exposure drafts (must include dissenting opinions), approve IFRS IC interpretations; set technical agenda (discretionary but must consult Trustees and Advisory Council on major projects); undertake public agenda consultation every five years; ensure IASB standards are compatible and avoid inconsistency with ISSB standards; establish liaison with national standard-setters.<br>• Voting thresholds & meeting practice: approvals for exposure drafts and standards require approval by at least eight members if fewer than 14, or nine if 14 members; other decisions (e.g., discussion papers) require simple majority with at least 60% member attendance; IASB meets monthly (not in August), meetings open to public with materials posted online.<br><strong>2.4.1 Agenda consultation</strong><br>• Five-yearly public consultation required to gather views on strategic direction, balance of IASB activities and priority-setting criteria; latest consultation began March 2021 with a July 2022 feedback statement and adopted priorities for 2022–2026 including: progress current work plan projects; complete PIRs of IFRS 9 and conduct PIRs for IFRS 15 and IFRS 16; initiate research/projects on intangible assets and statement of cash flows; maintain a reserve list (operating segments, pollutant pricing mechanisms); coordinate with ISSB (management commentary, intangible assets research); start a narrow-scope project on climate-related accounting where needed; complete second comprehensive review of IFRS for SMEs and publish educational material. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.5 The IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC)</strong><br>• Role and remit: supports consistent application by timely assessment, discussion and resolution of application issues within the IFRS framework; tackles issues with a widespread or material effect, that reduce diversity in practice, that can be resolved within existing IFRS/Conceptual Framework, and are sufficiently narrow yet cost-effective to address.<br>• Process for issues: national standard-setters/regional bodies often consulted; IFRS IC may add items to its work programme, issue tentative agenda decisions if not adding items (normally ≥60-day comment period), then confirm agenda decision, revise/re-expose, add to work programme or refer to IASB.<br>• Interaction with IASB: before publishing an agenda decision, the IASB is asked at its first practical public meeting whether it objects; if four or more IASB members object the agenda decision is not published and IASB decides next steps.<br>• Composition & governance: IFRS IC has 14 voting members; chair appointed by Trustees (may be IASB member or qualified individual) but chair does not vote; regulatory representatives may attend as non-voting participants; observers include Basel Committee, European Commission and IOSCO; quorum is 10 members; approval of draft/final interpretations requires that not more than four voting members vote against.<br>• Meetings & ratification: IFRS IC meets about six times a year in public sessions; interpretations developed by IFRS IC must be ratified by IASB. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.5.1 Agenda decisions</strong><br>• Purpose: explain why a standard-setting project has not been added and provide explanatory material on application of existing IFRS to described fact patterns; cannot change or add requirements to IFRS standards but explanatory material derives authority from the standards and entities must apply standards reflecting such explanatory material.<br>• Implementation timing guidance: IASB recognises agenda decisions can introduce persuasive new information; entities are not automatically in error for prior applications inconsistent with an agenda decision; IASB expects companies to have “sufficient time” (judgement; IASB suggested “a matter of months rather than years”) to implement accounting policy changes resulting from agenda decisions; companies should implement changes promptly and consider disclosure about implementation if material. The Due Process Handbook amended Aug 2020 to reflect these positions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.6 The Due Process Handbook</strong><br>• Oversight: DPOC (Trustees’ Due Process Oversight Committee) oversees due process for IASB and IFRS IC across development stages including agenda-setting and PIRs.<br>• August 2020 revisions highlights: clarified authority/role of IFRS IC agenda decisions and formal inclusion of IASB in finalisation; emphasised the role of effect analyses at all stages of standard-setting; streamlined consultation requirements for adding major projects to IASB work plan; enhanced minimum review for Foundation educational material; clarified DPOC’s oversight of IFRS Taxonomy due process.<br>• Core due process principles: Transparency; Full and fair consultation; Accountability (including analysis of effects and rationale in Basis for Conclusions).<br>• Mandatory steps required before issuing standards/interpretations: debate proposals in public meetings; publish exposure drafts with minimum comment periods; consider comment letters timely; consider re-exposure where needed; consult Advisory Council and ASAF on work plan/major projects; ratify interpretations in public IASB meetings.<br>• Non-mandatory (comply-or-explain) steps: publishing discussion papers prior to exposure drafts; establishing consultative or specialist advisory groups; holding public hearings; undertaking fieldwork. If non-mandatory steps are omitted the IASB must notify DPOC and publish reasons in decision summaries and Basis for Conclusions.<br>• Comment periods: typical exposure draft comment period is 120 days; for narrow/urgent matters comment period can be not less than 30 days after DPOC consultation/approval; in exceptional ‘fast track’ urgent cases, with 75% Trustee approval, comment period may be reduced below 30 days but cannot be eliminated. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.7 The IFRS Advisory Council</strong><br>• Purpose: forum for geographically and functionally diverse organisations/individuals to provide input on IASB/ISSB agenda, priorities, project timetables, and application/implementation issues; flag matters for IFRS IC attention.<br>• Composition & meetings: 30+ members with diverse backgrounds; chair appointed by Trustees (cannot be IASB/ISSB member); normally meets at least twice a year in public; members serve initial three-year terms with possible extensions up to three additional years. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.8 Accounting Standards Advisory Forum (ASAF)</strong><br>• Purpose: advisory forum of national standard-setters/regional bodies to provide technical advice/feedback to IASB and to coordinate national/regional views on major technical issues.<br>• Membership & meetings: 12 non-voting members (appointed by Trustees) representing national standard-setters/regions, plus IASB chair/vice-chair as chair; geographical spread aims for 1 Africa, 3 Americas, 3 Asia/Oceania, 3 Europe, 2 any area; meets about 4 times a year (some videoconference meetings); meetings are public. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.9 Other advisory bodies</strong><br>• Formal advisory/consultative groups listed: Integrated Reporting & Connectivity Council; Capital Markets Advisory Committee; Emerging Economies Group; Global Preparers Forum; IFRS Taxonomy Consultative Group; Islamic Finance Consultative Group; SME Implementation Group; Consultative Group for Rate Regulation; Management Commentary Consultative Group. These groups provide project-specific input and assist IASB outreach. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>2.10 The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)</strong><br>• Background & establishment: Trustees formed task force (Oct 2019), public consultation (Sept 2020) and amended Constitution (Nov 2021) to create ISSB within Foundation governance to set IFRS sustainability disclosure standards and provide a global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures for investors.<br>• Consolidation & collaboration: Foundation consolidated Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and Value Reporting Foundation (VRF — integrated reporting + SASB) into ISSB; collaboration agreement signed with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in Mar 2022 to coordinate standard-setting/activity where appropriate.<br>• Structure & outputs: ISSB has multi-location presence (Americas, EMEA, Asia), comprises 14 members plus advisory groups; May 2023 issued Request for Information on Agenda Priorities (comment period to Sept 2023); June 2023 ISSB issued inaugural standards IFRS S1 (General Requirements) and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures), effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 Jan 2024, with transition reliefs; mandatory application depends on jurisdictional endorsement/regulatory decisions and is not linked to an entity’s use of IASB IFRS accounting standards. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>3 The IASB’s technical agenda and convergence with US GAAP</strong><br><strong>3.1 The IASB’s current priorities and future agenda</strong><br>• 2023 focus areas (selected): exposure draft on annual improvements; urgent SME amendment aligned with IAS 12 temporary measures (OECD international tax reform relief); project direction set on business combinations under common control; research on climate-related effects on financial statements and potential accounting responses; exploration & evaluation disclosures project; exposure draft to clarify IAS 32 equity vs liability classification challenges; continuing implementation of projects into 2024+.<br><strong>3.2 IFRS accounting standards/US GAAP convergence</strong><br>• Convergence history: intensive IASB–FASB convergence activities 2002–2013; US SEC actions (permitting foreign private issuers to file IFRS without reconciliation from 2007; proposed roadmap 2008; 2011 staff work plan) produced mixed outcomes; by 2013 convergence ceased being a major agenda driver and IASB refocused on single-set high-quality global standards. The Handbook revised in 2013 removed convergence as an influential agenda factor. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4 The adoption of IFRS accounting standards around the world</strong><br><strong>4.1 Worldwide adoption overview</strong><br>• Adoption modes: full adoption of IASB-issued IFRS; endorsement/adoption process (e.g., EU/UK); convergence (local GAAP aligned to IFRS but may contain mandatory or optional departures); voluntary adoption for certain issuers; IFRS for SMEs adoption by smaller/private entities in some jurisdictions.<br>• IFRS 1 First-time Adoption: entities asserting compliance with IFRS must apply IFRS 1 when first asserting compliance; local amendments or deviations from IASB text preclude an entity from claiming compliance with IASB-issued IFRS.<br>• Jurisdiction profiles: Foundation provides profiles for jurisdictions (168 profiles at time of writing).<br><strong>Selected jurisdiction summaries (detailed)</strong><br>• Australia — Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) are IFRS-equivalent word-for-word with Australian-specific paragraphs for NFP/public sector; required for publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities; non-publicly accountable entities can apply AAS recognition/measurement with the Simplified Disclosure Standard (SDS) option; SDS mirrors IFRS for SMEs disclosures with Australian overlays; AAS compliance allows explicit statements of compliance with IASB IFRS for for-profit entities.<br>• Brazil — Local CPCs converged with IFRS since 2010; regulated public companies required to comply (with some sectoral exceptions for banks/real estate historically); CPCs used for non-public companies; industry-specific local policies (e.g., homebuilding revenue recognition) remain.<br>• Canada — Publicly accountable enterprises required to apply IFRS as Canadian GAAP from 1 Jan 2011 (some temporary deferrals expired); AcSB adopts IASB standards as Canadian GAAP and may issue wraparound exposure drafts and stakeholder outreach; non-public entities may use other bases derived from Canadian standards or voluntarily use IFRS.<br>• Mainland China — ASBE substantially converged with IFRS but with specific differences (e.g., common-control business combinations, impairment reversal prohibition for long-lived assets, fair value model restrictions for investment property); MOF Road Map (Apr 2010) requires ASBE for listed companies, selected financial enterprises and large/medium enterprises; ongoing cooperation with IASB (2005/2015 Beijing joint statements) to maintain convergence; MOF issued interpretations in 2022–23 to align certain items (deferred tax single-transaction exemption, income tax on dividends on equity-classified instruments, share-based payment reclassification) with IASB amendments.<br>• Hong Kong — HKFRS (including HKAS and Interpretations) fully converged with IFRS since 1 Jan 2005 subject to limited exceptions; HKICPA may add disclosures or, in rare cases, deviate; HKFRS applied by Hong Kong incorporated entities (listed & non-listed); a SME/local small-entity framework exists.<br>• Japan — Voluntary adoption permitted for eligible listed companies that meet governance conditions; standalone financials remain Japanese GAAP; endorsement mechanism used to designate IASB IFRS for voluntary adoption; Japan’s Modified International Standards (JMIS) were developed (goodwill amortisation and OCI recycling) but currently unused; ~270 companies had adopted IFRS voluntarily by July 2023 (representing >45% of market cap).<br>• India — Ind AS (converged IFRS) phased in from financial years beginning on/after 1 Apr 2016 with mandatory and optional departures; central bodies (ICAI, NFRA, MCA) and sectoral regulators (RBI, IRDA) involved; companies not in roadmap may voluntary adopt Ind AS irrevocably (except NBFCs); SEBI required mutual fund AMCs to prepare financial statements in Ind AS from 1 Apr 2023 (first Ind AS MF statements year ending 31 Mar 2024).<br>• Korea — K-IFRS (IFRS as adopted in Korea) required for listed entities, unlisted financial institutions and state-owned entities; permitted for non-listed entities.<br>• Mainland China — see above (ASBE).<br>• Saudi Arabia — IFRS as adopted by local regulators required for banks, insurers and listed entities; other frameworks (IPSAS, AAOIFI) may apply to government or Islamic institutions; non-listed entities may choose IFRS or IFRS for SMEs.<br>• Singapore — SFRS(I) converged with IFRS required for Singapore incorporated listed entities; foreign entities listed in Singapore required to file SFRS(I), IFRS or US GAAP depending on status; Singapore incorporated entities may file IFRS with approval.<br>• South Africa — JSE required IFRS for all listed companies from 1 Jan 2005; Companies Act (effective 1 May 2011) allows frameworks by public interest score; listed companies required to use IFRS; other entities may apply IFRS, IFRS for SMEs or entity-specific accounting for micro-entities; local Financial Reporting Guides supplement IFRS application.<br>• Spain, France, Germany, Italy — follow EU-adopted IFRS rules per EU Regulation; many EU members permit EU IFRS application in non-listed consolidated and separate statements; Italy extends EU IFRS use in some separate financial statements by exchange rules (subject to exceptions).<br>• Switzerland — Listed issuers incorporated in Switzerland and listed under SIX International Reporting Standard must apply IFRS or US GAAP; other listed entities may apply IFRS, US GAAP or Swiss GAAP-FER; IFRS permitted in consolidated statutory financial statements for listed/non-listed entities.<br>• Taiwan — Taiwan-IFRS (endorsed local standards) effective dates generally aligned with global dates (effective from 1 Jan 2023 for standards/interpretations listed); IFRS permitted for foreign issuers with reconciliation to Taiwan-IFRS.<br>• Thailand — Thai Accounting Standards substantially converged with IFRS; effective dates often one year later than IASB; IFRS permitted for foreign companies.<br>• UAE — Companies generally required by law to apply IFRS; government and Islamic entities may use IPSAS or AAOIFI respectively. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.2 Europe</strong><br><strong>4.2.1 EU</strong><br>• Regulation No 1606/2002 required consolidated financial statements of listed EU companies to use EU-adopted IFRS by 2005; Regulation includes an endorsement mechanism to adopt IASB standards into EU law to ensure public oversight and to assess conformity with EU public policy.<br>• Endorsement process: European Commission (EC) decides after advice from EFRAG and vote by Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC) of member states; EFRAG plays a central advisory role, conducting proactive outreach, field tests and advice; endorsement is completed only when published in the Official Journal of the EU.<br><strong>4.2.1.A Endorsed IFRS accounting standards</strong><br>• Endorsement record: most IASB standards effective have been endorsed for EU use except certain carve-outs and non-endorsements (IAS 39 carve-out for macro fair value hedge accounting; decision not to endorse IFRS 14; pending endorsement of IAS 12 amendments re Pillar Two Model Rules).<br>• Specific EU carve-out example: IAS 39 carve-out permitting macro fair value hedge accounting in EU where IASB removal of carve-out in IFRS 9 did not address EU concerns; EU also provided an optional exemption when endorsing IFRS 17 to allow opt-out from annual cohort requirement for intergenerationally mutualised and cash-flow-matched contracts (article requires disclosure if exemption used; review clause set for 31 Dec 2027).<br><strong>4.2.1.B Evaluation of the Regulation</strong><br>• 2014 EC evaluation and 2015 report: concluded IFRS created a common accounting language and remains dominant; identified areas for improvement.<br>• 2018 HLEG on Sustainable Finance recommended that adoption consider European public good and sustainability objectives; EC’s 2018 Fitness Check consulted widely and most respondents supported status quo and cautioned against EU-specific carve-ins that risked fragmentation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.2.2 United Kingdom</strong><br>• Post-Brexit regime: from financial years beginning on or after 1 Jan 2021 UK incorporated companies not applying UK GAAP use UK-adopted international accounting standards (UK-adopted IAS) rather than EU IFRS; UK Endorsement Board has authority to endorse new/amended standards; entities listed on non-UK regulated markets must ensure they follow the appropriate applicable framework (EU-adopted IFRS or IASB IFRS) as required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.3 Americas</strong><br><strong>4.3.1 US</strong><br>• Convergence note: see 3.2; US SEC permits foreign private issuers to file IFRS financial statements without reconciliation to US GAAP; there is no US endorsement mechanism for IASB IFRS for domestic issuers.<br><strong>4.3.2 Canada</strong><br>• IFRS mandatory for publicly accountable enterprises from 1 Jan 2011; AcSB integrates IASB standards into Canadian GAAP for those entities, issues wraparound EDs for Canadian input and may perform outreach; AcSB may modify standards but intends to avoid changing IASB requirements when adopting them as Canadian GAAP wherever possible.<br><strong>4.3.3 Brazil</strong><br>• CPCs converged with IFRS since 2010; CVM-regulated public companies must make formal IFRS compliance statements for consolidated financial statements; banking regulators may require additional local rules; insurance sector adopted CPCs/IFRS in 2011. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.4 Asia</strong><br><strong>4.4.1 Mainland China</strong><br>• ASBE convergence path: MOF/CASC-led ASBE series introduced since 2006 with Road Map (Apr 2010) mandating ASBE for listed companies and many large entities; ASBE substantially converged with IFRS with China-specific rules retained where necessary; 2015/2015 joint meetings with Trustees reaffirmed convergence objective and established further cooperation; MOF issued interpretations during July 2022–June 2023 to align certain tax/share-based payment rules with IASB amendments. Notable divergences: absence of IFRS-equivalent for common-control business combinations and prohibition on reversing impairment for long-lived assets in ASBE.<br><strong>4.4.1.B Hong Kong</strong><br>• HKFRS fully converged with IFRS since 2005; HKICPA may introduce additional disclosure requirements or, in exceptional cases, deviate (transitional exceptions noted); a small/SME reporting framework exists for eligible small groups.<br><strong>4.4.2 Japan</strong><br>• Voluntary adoption regime with endorsement/designation of IASB standards for voluntary use; standalone financials remain Japanese GAAP; JMIS exists as an alternative modified IFRS (amortise goodwill; recycle OCI) but is unused; voluntary adopters represent a minority of listed companies but a significant portion of market capitalisation (~270 companies by July 2023).<br><strong>4.4.3 India</strong><br>• Ind AS introduced via MCA notifications (Feb 2015) with phased application from Apr 2016 for many entities; central regulator/standard-setter framework involves ICAI, NFRA and MCA; sectoral regulators (RBI, IRDA) set implementation timetables for banks/insurers with some deferrals; voluntary adoption option exists but irrevocable; SEBI’s 2022 amendment mandates Ind AS for mutual fund AMCs from 1 Apr 2023 (first Ind AS mutual fund financials year ending 31 Mar 2024). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.5 Australia</strong><br>• AAS regime: Australian Accounting Standards are IFRS-equivalent for for-profit private sector entities, with Australian paragraphs for NFP and public sector; compliance with AAS generally equates to compliance with IASB IFRS for entities that are publicly accountable and do not elect SDS.<br>• Simplified Disclosure Standard (SDS): available to non-publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities (and certain not-for-profit/public sector reporting entities) that are required to prepare statements that comply with accounting standards; SDS applies IFRS recognition/measurement but reduced disclosures closely based on IFRS for SMEs; SDS financial statements are general purpose but cannot claim compliance with IASB IFRS. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>4.6 South Africa</strong><br>• Adoption: JSE required IFRS for listed companies from 1 Jan 2005; Companies Act (effective 1 May 2011) allows application of different accounting frameworks depending on an entity’s public interest score (listed companies required to use IFRS; others may use IFRS, IFRS for SMEs or entity-specific accounting for micro-entities).<br>• Local guidance: prior standard-setter Accounting Practices Board issued Financial Reporting Guides used by IFRS reporters in South Africa; additional disclosure/requirements from JSE and Companies Act overlay IFRS requirements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>5 Consistency in application of IFRS accounting standards</strong><br>• Core point: adoption is necessary but not sufficient; consistent application, auditing and enforcement are required to achieve comparability benefits such as lower cost of capital and improved market functioning (evidence stronger where enforcement is robust).<br>• Enforcement mechanisms and cooperation: ESMA developed common enforcement priorities and guidelines (effective Dec 2014) to harmonise EU enforcement; Foundation has Statements of Protocols with ESMA and IOSCO to support consistent application and cooperation; US SEC uses filing reviews and bilateral/multilateral cooperation to enforce IFRS application in foreign private issuers’ filings.<br>• Tools for enhancing consistency: post-implementation reviews (PIRs) of major standards (IFRS 9 completed; IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 PIRs planned/ongoing); IFRS IC agenda decisions to reduce diversity; ASAF and national standard-setters’ liaison; educational material and Foundation outreach.<br>• Practical note for preparers: if jurisdiction endorses or modifies an IFRS standard locally, that local version is the applicable financial reporting basis — modifications preclude claiming compliance with IASB-issued IFRS. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>6 Summary</strong><br>• Status: IFRS accounting standards and US GAAP remain the two primary global frameworks. While a single worldwide accounting regime has not been fully achieved, widespread adoption, convergence and institutional governance have established IFRS accounting standards as “International GAAP” in practice.<br>• Governance & future orientation: IASB and ISSB operate independently but with high interconnectivity; coordination is required to ensure compatibility between financial reporting standards and sustainability disclosure standards; agenda-setting emphasises high-quality standard-setting, PIRs, effect analyses and stakeholder consultation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>Appendices, procedural details and practical checks</strong><br><strong>Due process minimum steps</strong><br>• Mandatory: public debates/meetings; exposure drafts with minimum comment periods (normally 120 days); timely consideration of comments; consult Advisory Council and ASAF on major projects; ratify interpretations in public IASB meeting.<br>• Non-mandatory (comply-or-explain): publish discussion papers before EDs; set up consultative/advisory groups; hold public hearings; fieldwork. IASB must notify DPOC and explain omission.<br><strong>IFRS IC agenda decision mechanics</strong><br>• Tentative agenda decision published with at least ~60-day comment period; after comment review IFRS IC may confirm, revise/re-expose, add to work programme or refer to IASB; IASB may object (4+ IASB member objections block publication). Agenda decisions explain application of existing standards and cannot introduce new requirements but have persuasive authority and require timely company consideration and implementation as appropriate.<br><strong>Voting thresholds & quorums</strong><br>• IASB: approval of exposure drafts and standards normally requires at least 8 votes if fewer than 14 members (9 votes if 14 members); other decisions require simple majority with at least 60% member attendance.<br>• IFRS IC: 14 voting members; quorum 10; approval of draft/final interpretations allowed if not more than four voting members vote against. Chair does not vote; observers may attend without voting rights. <br><strong>ISSB transition & application</strong><br>• ISSB inaugural standards IFRS S1 and S2 effective for annual periods beginning on/after 1 Jan 2024; transition reliefs provided; mandatory adoption dependent on jurisdictional endorsement/regulation; application of ISSB standards is independent from application of IASB financial reporting standards (entities may apply one without the other, depending on jurisdiction).<br><strong>Jurisdictional endorsement and carve-outs</strong><br>• EU endorsement mechanism (Regulation 1606/2002) uses EFRAG advice and ARC votes; endorsement ends with publication in Official Journal. EU has used carve-outs (IAS 39 macro hedge carve-out) and optional exemptions (IFRS 17 annual cohort exemption for certain life-insurance contracts) subject to disclosures and review clauses (e.g., review by 31 Dec 2027). UK now uses UK-adopted IAS post-2021 with its own endorsement arrangements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>Practical actions for preparers and auditors</strong><br>• When asserting compliance with IFRS ensure you apply IASB-issued standards in full (use IFRS 1 on first assertion). If local endorsement or convergence produced deviations, do not claim compliance with IASB IFRS unless full alignment is achieved.<br>• Monitor IFRS IC agenda decisions, IASB PIRs and national endorsement developments; allow sufficient time for implementation of agenda-decision-driven accounting policy changes; disclose implementation progress if material.<br>• Maintain close liaison with national regulators and enforcers, apply the local endorsed standard text where applicable, and document sources and calculation conventions to support consistent application. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 1 — International GAAP"> <strong>References & evidence in chapter text</strong><br>• Primary internal references include: IFRS Foundation Constitution (Nov 2021), Due Process Handbook (Aug 2020), Trustees’ and IASB publications (agenda consultation materials July 2022), EFRAG/EC documents (endorsement/regulation references), IFRS Foundation annual report 2022 and press releases noted in chapter.

broadly effective for preparers from 1 January 2020 where references updated. <br>• Replaces carried-forward material from the 1989 Framework and amends parts of 2010 Framework; some standards still reference earlier versions where the Board decided not to update references immediately. <br>• Purpose: provide coherent concepts to assist the IASB in developing IFRSs, to help preparers develop accounting policies where no specific IFRS applies (or where a choice exists), and to assist all parties to understand and interpret IFRS. <br>• Not a standard and does not override any specific IFRS; the Board may specify requirements that depart from the Framework but will explain departures in the basis for conclusions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>What you need to know</strong><br>• The Framework sets the objective of general purpose financial reporting and the concepts (qualitative characteristics, elements, recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure, capital concepts). <br>• Use when no standard applies or when a standard permits policy choice; preparers must consider definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts from the Framework. <br>• Emphasis on relevance and faithful representation; enhancing characteristics: comparability, verifiability, timeliness, understandability; pervasive cost constraint. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>1 Introduction</strong><br><strong>What is a conceptual framework</strong><br>• A conceptual framework is a statement of generally accepted theoretical principles forming the frame of reference for standard-setting and accounting practice—answers which events to account for, how to measure them and how to communicate them. <br><strong>Historical development</strong><br>• Early academic work (Paton & Littleton 1940; AAA committees) influenced initial frameworks. <br>• IASB–FASB joint project (2004→2010 first phase), restart as IASB-only project (2012), DP July 2013, ED May 2015, final Framework March 2018. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>1.2 Why a conceptual framework is necessary</strong><br>• Provides a theory for testing practical accounting solutions and guides consistent standard-setting; reduces ad hoc and mutually inconsistent rules. <br>• Addresses recurring theoretical tensions (substance vs form, neutrality vs prudence, balance-sheet vs matching). <br>• Recognises it is not a panacea—judgement remains necessary; standards may diverge from Framework (examples: IAS 38 goodwill treatment; IAS 12 deferred tax recognition rules). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>2 Development and effective date</strong><br><strong>2010, 2013, 2015, 2018 timeline</strong><br>• 2010 Framework partly joint with FASB; 2018 is full revision replacing earlier carried-forward material. <br><strong>Use by Board and IFRS IC</strong><br>• IASB and IFRS Interpretations Committee began using 2018 Framework on issuance; IFRS IC will refer issues to the Board if inconsistency between a standard and 2018 Framework arises. <br><strong>Amendments to references</strong><br>• Board issued Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework (Mar 2018) updating references in Standards where appropriate; effective for periods beginning on or after 1 Jan 2020. <br><strong>Exceptions and transitional references</strong><br>• Some pronouncements continue to refer to the 1989 or 2010 Framework (examples listed in standards: IFRIC 12, IFRIC 19 reference 1989; IFRS 14, IFRIC 20, IFRIC 22 reference 2010; IFRS 3 transitional reference to 2010 until at latest 1 Jan 2022). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>3 Contents, purpose and scope</strong><br><strong>Structure</strong><br>• Introductory section on status and purpose, 8 chapters, Appendix of defined terms (editorial extraction of definitions). <br><strong>Chapters list</strong><br>• Chapter 1 Objective; Chapter 2 Qualitative characteristics; Chapter 3 Financial statements & reporting entity; Chapter 4 Elements; Chapter 5 Recognition & derecognition; Chapter 6 Measurement; Chapter 7 Presentation & disclosure; Chapter 8 Concepts of capital & capital maintenance. <br><strong>Status and purpose</strong><br>• Assist Board in developing IFRSs, preparers in developing policies where no standard applies or choice exists, and all parties to interpret IFRS. <br>• Framework is not authoritative over standards; revisions do not automatically amend standards—standards change only via normal due process. <br>• Framework frames Board’s public-interest mission: transparency, accountability, economic efficiency. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>4 Chapter 1 Objective of general purpose financial reporting</strong><br><strong>Core objective</strong><br>• To provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in decisions about providing resources to the entity (buy/sell/hold equity or debt; lending or settling loans; exercising governance rights). [CF 1.2] <br><strong>Primary users</strong><br>• Existing/potential investors, lenders and other creditors are primary users; reports are prepared for users with reasonable knowledge who will perform diligent analysis. [CF 1.5, CF 2.36] <br><strong>Scope of information</strong><br>• Users need info on amount, timing and uncertainty of prospective net cash inflows and on stewardship (management’s use of resources). [CF 1.3, CF 1.4] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>4.1 Objective usefulness and limitations</strong><br><strong>Usefulness</strong><br>• Enables assessment of returns (dividends, principal, interest, market value increases) via forecast of net cash inflows and stewardship evaluation. <br><strong>Limitations</strong><br>• Reports do not supply all information needed by providers of capital (macro, industry or non-financial forward-looking intel); not designed to show entity value but to help users estimate it. <br><strong>Estimates and judgement</strong><br>• Financial statements rely on estimates/judgements and models—Framework sets concepts to guide these but perfection is unlikely; transparency and disclosure needed. [CF 1.11] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>4.2 Information about resources claims and changes</strong><br><strong>Economic resources and claims</strong><br>• Reporting should convey nature and amounts of resources (assets) and claims (liabilities/equity) to assess liquidity, solvency, priority of claims and stewardship. [CF 1.13-1.14] <br><strong>Changes in resources and claims</strong><br>• Financial performance and other events (issuances, repayments) change resources/claims; balance-sheet approach derives performance from movements in position; accrual accounting underpins period recognition. [CF 1.15-1.18] <br><strong>Stewardship</strong><br>• Information showing how efficiently and effectively management used economic resources helps forecast future use and hold management accountable. [CF 1.22-1.23] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>5 Chapter 2 Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information</strong><br><strong>Framework view</strong><br>• Fundamental characteristics: <strong>Relevance</strong> and <strong>Faithful representation</strong>. <br>• Enhancing characteristics: <strong>Comparability</strong>, <strong>Verifiability</strong>, <strong>Timeliness</strong>, <strong>Understandability</strong>. <br>• Pervasive cost constraint limits the provision of information. [CF 2.1, CF 2.23, CF 2.39] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>5.1 Fundamental qualitative characteristics</strong><br><strong>Relevance</strong><br>• Information capable of making a difference via predictive value and/or confirmatory value; materiality is entity-specific and depends on nature/magnitude in context—no uniform quantitative threshold. [CF 2.6-2.11] <br><strong>Faithful representation</strong><br>• Depiction must be complete, neutral and free from error (practicable); represent substance over legal form where substance differs. [CF 2.12-2.15] <br><strong>Prudence</strong><br>• Prudence = caution in judgements under uncertainty to support neutrality; does not permit biasing information to systematically under/overstate. [CF 2.16-2.17] <br><strong>Measurement uncertainty</strong><br>• Reasonable estimates are acceptable; high uncertainty does not automatically preclude usefulness if transparently described. [CF 2.19] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>5.1.3 Applying the fundamental characteristics</strong><br>• Process: identify phenomenon → choose most relevant information type → assess if it can be faithfully represented → if not, iterate to next best. [CF 2.21] <br>• Trade-offs possible: highly relevant information with high uncertainty may still be presented with disclosures; where measures lack faithfulness, choose less relevant but more faithful alternatives. [CF 2.22] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>5.2 Enhancing qualitative characteristics</strong><br><strong>Comparability</strong><br>• Enables identification of similarities/differences across entities/periods; consistency supports comparability but is not the same thing; uniformity is not required and making unlike things look alike is undesirable. [CF 2.24-2.29] <br><strong>Verifiability</strong><br>• Information is verifiable when independent observers can reach consensus that depiction is faithful; includes direct (observe) and indirect (check inputs & recalculation) verification. [CF 2.30-2.32] <br><strong>Timeliness</strong><br>• Information must be available early enough to influence decisions; older information may still be timely for trend analysis. [CF 2.33] <br><strong>Understandability</strong><br>• Clear classification, characterisation and concise presentation; prepared for users with reasonable business knowledge; complex items should not be excluded merely because they are complex—disclosure required. [CF 2.34-2.36] <br><strong>Applying enhancing characteristics</strong><br>• Iterative application; may be necessary to sacrifice one enhancing characteristic to improve another (e.g., prospective change to accounting reduces short-term comparability); use disclosures to mitigate. [CF 2.37-2.38] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>5.3 The cost constraint</strong><br>• Benefits of information must justify costs to preparer and users; cost ultimately borne by users via reduced returns. <br>• Board assesses costs/benefits via outreach; requirements may differ by entity size, capital-raising method and users’ needs. [CF 2.39-2.43] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>6 Chapter 3 Financial statements and the reporting entity</strong><br><strong>Role of financial statements</strong><br>• Provide information about assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses, unrecognised items, cash flows, equity contributions/distributions, and methods/judgements used. Recognised items must meet element definitions. [CF 3.1, CF 5.1] <br><strong>Reporting period and comparatives</strong><br>• Prepared for a specified reporting period; comparative information for at least one preceding period to identify trends. [CF 3.4-3.5] <br><strong>Forward-looking information and subsequent events</strong><br>• Forward-looking info included if it relates to assets/liabilities or income/expenses for the period and is useful; post-period events included when necessary to meet objectives. [CF 3.6-3.7] <br><strong>Perspective and going concern</strong><br>• Reports present entity-level perspective; normally prepared on going concern unless entity intends or needs to liquidate/cease trading, in which case different basis disclosed. [CF 3.8-3.9] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>6.2 The reporting entity</strong><br><strong>Definition and boundaries</strong><br>• A reporting entity is any entity required or choosing to prepare financial statements; can be single legal entity, portion, consolidated group, combined entity; not necessarily a legal entity. [CF 3.10] <br><strong>Consolidated versus unconsolidated</strong><br>• Consolidated statements include parent and subsidiaries as a single reporting entity (useful for parent’s investors because distributions from subsidiaries affect parent cash flows). Unconsolidated show parent alone and may be supplementary to consolidated statements but cannot substitute when consolidation is required. [CF 3.11, CF 3.15-3.18] <br><strong>Combined and carve-out statements</strong><br>• Combined financial statements acknowledged as potentially useful; Framework does not specify preparation rules—Board may develop future standard. Carve-out discussion is silent but similar considerations apply. [CF BC3.21, CF 3.12-3.14] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7 Chapter 4 Elements of financial statements</strong><br><strong>Elements defined</strong><br>• Assets: present economic resources controlled by entity from past events. <br>• Liabilities: present obligations to transfer economic resources as a result of past events. <br>• Equity: residual interest in assets after deducting liabilities. <br>• Income: increases in assets or decreases in liabilities that increase equity, other than owner contributions. <br>• Expenses: decreases in assets or increases in liabilities that decrease equity, other than distributions to owners. [CF 4.1-4.4, CF 4.68-4.71] <br><strong>Other changes</strong><br>• Exchanges that do not change equity, and owner contributions/distributions, are other changes distinct from income/expenses. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7.1 Matters concerning both assets and liabilities</strong><br><strong>Unit of account</strong><br>• The right/group of rights or obligation(s) to which recognition and measurement apply; selection aims to provide relevant and faithful information while considering cost. May differ by recognition versus measurement. Examples: individual right, single contract, subgroup, portfolio of similar items, portfolio of dissimilar items, risk exposure within portfolio. [CF 4.48-4.55] <br><strong>Executory contracts</strong><br>• Contracts equally unperformed create combined right/obligation—treated as single asset if favourable, single liability if unfavourable; recognition depends on recognition criteria and measurement basis, including onerous contract test. [CF 4.56-4.58] <br><strong>Substance of contractual rights and obligations</strong><br>• Report substance over legal form; consider explicit and implicit terms unless they have no substance (no effect on economics); group/series of contracts may require combined accounting to reflect commercial effect. [CF 4.59-4.62] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7.2 Definition of assets</strong><br><strong>Rights</strong><br>• Rights may arise from contracts, legislation, constructive obligations, or control of non-public know-how; rights include receivables, rights over physical objects, IP, options, forward contracts. Not all rights are assets (public goods, public domain know-how). Treasury shares and intra-group holdings within a reporting entity are not assets of the reporting entity. [CF 4.5-4.13] <br><strong>Potential to produce economic benefits</strong><br>• A right is an economic resource if it has potential to produce economic benefits in at least one circumstance; low probability does not preclude asset classification but affects recognition and measurement. [CF 4.14-4.18] <br><strong>Control</strong><br>• Control = present ability to direct use and obtain benefits and to prevent others from doing so; arises from legal rights or other means (e.g., ability to keep know-how secret); principal-agent distinctions apply (agent custody does not equal agent asset). [CF 4.19-4.25] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7.3 Definition of liabilities</strong><br><strong>Obligation</strong><br>• A duty or responsibility the entity has no practical ability to avoid; may be legal or constructive; obligation is owed to another party even if identity unknown. [CF 4.26-4.31] <br><strong>Transfer of economic resource</strong><br>• Obligation must potentially require transfer of economic resource—cash, goods/services, unfavourable exchange, contingent transfers, issuing a financial instrument that obliges transfer. Probability can be low; disclosure may substitute for recognition. [CF 4.36-4.41] <br><strong>Present obligation from past events</strong><br>• Obligation arises from past events or from benefits received or actions taken; enactment of legislation creates obligation only when entity has obtained benefits or taken actions to which it applies. Present obligation can exist even if payment/enforcement occurs in future. [CF 4.42-4.47] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7.4 Definition of equity</strong><br>• Residual interest after liabilities deducted; equity claims do not meet liability definition; classes of equity carry different rights (dividends, liquidation proceeds); legal/regulatory constraints (distributable reserves) may require separate disclosure/presentation. [CF 4.63-4.67] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>7.5 Definition of income and expenses</strong><br>• Income = increases in assets or decreases in liabilities increasing equity other than owner contributions. <br>• Expenses = decreases in assets or increases in liabilities decreasing equity other than distributions to owners. <br>• Contributions from owners are not income; distributions to owners are not expenses. Different transactions produce income/expenses with differing characteristics—presentation of components can aid user understanding. [CF 4.68-4.72] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>8 Chapter 5 Recognition and derecognition</strong><br><strong>Recognition process</strong><br>• Capturing an item that meets element definition into the statement(s) with a monetary amount (carrying amount). Recognition links opening/closing statements and performance via double-entry relationships; recognition decisions affect totals and reconciliation between position and performance. [CF 5.1-5.4] <br><strong>Recognition criteria</strong><br>• Only items meeting the definitions may be recognised, and only if recognition provides relevant information and a faithful representation (and costs justified). Not all definitional matches are recognised; judgement required. [CF 5.6-5.9] <br><strong>Consideration of non-recognition</strong><br>• If non-recognition, present note disclosure to compensate and ensure visibility—assess whether expense recognition might provide useful trend info. [CF 5.10-5.11] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>8.2 Recognition criteria — relevance</strong><br><strong>Existence uncertainty</strong><br>• When existence is uncertain and combined with low probability or wide outcome ranges, single-amount recognition may not be relevant; disclose uncertainties. [CF 5.12-5.16] <br><strong>Low probability of inflow/outflow</strong><br>• Low probability items may be assets/liabilities but the most relevant info may be magnitude/timing/probability in notes rather than recognition; however, exchange transaction costs/consideration may warrant recognition. [CF 5.15-5.17] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>8.2 Recognition criteria — faithful representation</strong><br><strong>Measurement uncertainty</strong><br>• Measurement estimates are acceptable; high measurement uncertainty may prevent faithful representation and thus recognition; provide explanatory disclosures where appropriate. [CF 5.18-5.23] <br><strong>Other factors</strong><br>• Faithful representation requires appropriate measurement, presentation and disclosure; consider accounting mismatches, related items, and whether presentation/disclosure can achieve faithful depiction. [CF 5.24-5.25] </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 2 — The IASB’s Conceptual Framework"> <strong>8.3 Derecognition</strong><br>• Derecognition = removal of all/part of recognised asset/liability when item no longer meets element definition (loss of control or extinguishment). [CF 5.26] <br>• Aims: faithfully represent retained components and effect of transaction; usually derecognise transferred/expired components, continue recognising retained components (become separate units of account) and present/ disclose retained/transferred components separately where necessary. [CF 5.27-5.28] <br>• Do not derecognise if entity retains control or exposure to significant variations in benefits; if derecognition would misrepresent change, consider continuing recognition of transferred component and treat proceeds as loan. [CF 5.29-5.32] <br>• Contract modifications: evaluate whether modification eliminates rights/obligations (derecognise), adds new ones (recognise as separate), or both (may need derecognition and recognition of new asset/liability when modification effectively replaces original).

[CF 6.1-6.3] <br><strong>Framework stance</strong><br>• No single basis suits all items; standards must choose or guide basis and implementation techniques; may specify techniques or simplified approaches; may use deemed cost at initial recognition in some cases.

These definitions align with IAS 1 and determine which items fall in scope of IFRS 5 rules. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.1 The concept of a disposal group</strong><br>• Disposal group = group of assets to be disposed of together in a single transaction and liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The group may include goodwill allocated to a CGU or an operation within a CGU.<br>• Only liabilities assumed by purchaser are included; liabilities to be repaid from sale proceeds typically excluded.<br>• A disposal group may be a single CGU, multiple CGUs or part of a CGU; once recovery becomes principally by sale, that group’s cash flows are less dependent on other assets and may be treated as separate CGU(s).<br><strong>2.1.1.A Deferred tax assets and liabilities in a disposal group</strong><br>• Whether deferred tax balances are included in the disposal group depends on whether they transfer to the buyer (common in share deals where tax bases remain with the legal entity) or will be realised/settled by the seller (common in asset deals). Entities must assess domestic tax treatment and transaction form; include only those deferred tax balances expected to be assumed by buyer. Reassess deferred tax measurement where manner of recovery is expected to change from use to sale. Disclose judgements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.2 Classification as held for sale or held for distribution to owners</strong><br><strong>Core criteria</strong><br>• To classify an asset or disposal group as held for sale an entity must demonstrate:<br> (a) asset/disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to usual and customary terms for such sales;<br> (b) sale is highly probable (significantly more likely than probable); and<br> (c) sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months from the date of classification and the sale is not abandoned (the “one-year rule”), subject to narrow exceptions.<br>• If criteria cease to be met the asset/disposal group must be declassified and remeasured as required. Classification timing matters: IFRS 5 applies from the date all criteria are met. If criteria are met after reporting date but before authorisation, disclosure is required. The same classification, presentation and measurement rules apply to items held for distribution to owners, with costs to distribute replacing costs to sell. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.2.A Meaning of available for immediate sale</strong><br>• “Available for immediate sale” means entity has intention and ability to transfer the asset/disposal group in its present condition; delays imposed by seller (e.g., vacating, completing renovations or winding down operations) indicate asset is not available for immediate sale. Examples: headquarters vacating timing, sale with/without operations, renovation or remediation needs — these facts affect availability. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.2.B Meaning of highly probable</strong><br><strong>Definition and indicators</strong><br>• Highly probable = “significantly more likely than probable” (with probable = more likely than not). Indicators that must be present (IFRS 5 guidance and IFRS IC commentary): commitment by appropriate level of management to a sale plan; an active programme to locate buyer and complete plan; active marketing at a price reasonable relative to current fair value; expectation that sale will qualify as completed sale within one year (with possible extensions in narrowly defined circumstances); actions indicating unlikely that plan will be significantly changed or withdrawn.<br><strong>Shareholder approval and evidence</strong><br>• If shareholder approval is required, assess likelihood of approval. Written consent from majority shareholder before reporting date is strong evidence; dispersed shareholding or controversial rationale reduces likelihood and may mean highly probable criterion not met.<br><strong>One-year rule and exceptions</strong><br>• Standard rule: sale expected to complete within 12 months. Exceptions where delay beyond one year does not preclude held-for-sale classification include:<br> (a) delay due to conditions imposed by others (e.g., regulatory approvals) that cannot be acted upon until after a firm purchase commitment and a firm purchase commitment is highly probable within one year;<br> (b) buyer unexpectedly imposes conditions after firm purchase commitment and seller takes timely actions with favourable outcome expected;<br> (c) market deterioration after classification makes sale extend beyond one year but entity actively markets at reasonable price and sale remains highly probable and available for immediate sale.<br>• No quantitative maximum extension specified; judgement needed and longer expected extensions reduce likelihood of meeting “highly probable”.<br><strong>Firm purchase commitment</strong><br>• Defined as a binding agreement with an unrelated party specifying all significant terms (price, timing) and containing a disincentive for non-performance large enough to make performance highly probable. Regulatory contingencies may still allow a firm purchase commitment to exist if other criteria are met. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.2.C Abandonment</strong><br>• Assets/disposal groups to be abandoned (used to the end of their economic life or closed rather than sold) must not be classified as held for sale because recovery is principally through continuing use. If a disposal group to be abandoned meets discontinued operation criteria, treat as discontinued in the period when it ceases to be used. Temporary suspension of use is not abandonment — apply impairment tests and reassess useful lives under IAS 36, IAS 16/IAS 38 as needed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.3 Partial disposals of operations</strong><br><strong>2.1.3.A Loss of control of a subsidiary</strong><br>• If a plan will result in loss of control of a subsidiary, classify all assets and liabilities of that subsidiary as held for sale when criteria are met regardless of retained interests (e.g., retained associate or JV).<br>• Debate exists for cases where retained interest is a joint operation (arguable that only disposed parts should be classified as held for sale). Pending any change to standard, entities may have a policy choice whether IFRS 5 applies to loss of control that results from partial disposals or other deemed disposals, but must apply consistently and disclose policy. If subsidiary meets discontinued operation definition, apply discontinued presentation/disclosure requirements.<br><strong>2.1.3.B Partial disposal of an associate or joint venture</strong><br>• IAS 28 requires that if a portion of an investment in an associate or JV meets held for sale criteria and is classified as held for sale, account for the retained portion using equity method until disposal of the portion classified as held for sale; upon disposal, subsequent accounting depends on nature of retained interest (IFRS 9 or continued equity method). If classification ceases, equity method applies retrospectively from original classification date. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.1.4 Deemed disposals</strong><br>• Deemed loss of control (dilution, contractual expiry, exercise/expiry of potential voting rights, etc.) is not explicitly addressed by IFRS 5. IASB Basis for Conclusions suggests loss of control is a significant economic event and could trigger held-for-sale treatment. IFRS IC has considered deemed disposals and recommended broader consideration; in practice entities need a consistent policy and should disclose. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2 Measurement of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale</strong><br><strong>2.2.1 Scope of measurement requirements</strong><br>• Measurement provisions (lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell) apply to all recognised non-current assets and disposal groups except items measured under other standards: deferred tax assets (IAS 12), employee benefit assets (IAS 19), financial assets (IFRS 9), investment property at fair value (IAS 40 fair value model), biological assets at fair value less costs to sell (IAS 41), and insurance contract groups (IFRS 4/IFRS 17). Those excluded items continue to be measured under their applicable standards even when included in a disposal group. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2.2 Measurement of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale</strong><br><strong>2.2.2.A Measurement on initial classification as held for sale</strong><br>• Immediately before classification, measure assets and liabilities in accordance with applicable IFRS accounting policies (i.e., the usual measurement basis up to classification date). After classification, measure the asset or disposal group at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.<br>• Fair value defined by IFRS 13. Costs to sell are incremental costs directly attributable to disposal excluding finance costs and income tax. If sale is expected beyond one year, measure costs to sell at present value and recognise unwinding of discount as finance cost.<br>• For disposal groups the measurement is applied to the group as a whole; any write-down is allocated among the non-current assets within the scope of IFRS 5 (no allocation to items outside scope). The fair value less costs to sell of a disposal group should reflect market-participant assumptions and may include unrecognised assets or liabilities that market participants would price. Items held for distribution to owners use fair value less costs to distribute.<br>• Newly acquired assets or disposal groups acquired exclusively with a view to disposal and meeting held-for-sale criteria on acquisition are measured at the lower of their carrying amount had they not been so classified (e.g., cost) and fair value less costs to sell — a business combination may therefore result in measurement at fair value less costs to sell on acquisition. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2.2.B Subsequent remeasurement</strong><br>• Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. Interest and other financing costs attributable to liabilities of a disposal group continue to be recognised.<br>• When remeasuring a disposal group, first remeasure items outside IFRS 5 measurement scope under their respective standards. OCI balances (e.g., revaluation surplus, foreign currency translation reserves, cash flow hedge reserves) related to items in the disposal group will be reclassified on disposal and may produce additional gains or losses on disposal; these are not anticipated in IFRS 5 measurement but are recognised at derecognition in accordance with applicable standards. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2.3 Impairments and reversals of impairment</strong><br>• Initial recognition of asset/disposal group at lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell may create an impairment loss when carrying amount exceeds fair value less costs to sell; recognise impairment under IFRS 5.<br>• Subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell are recognised as a gain but only up to the cumulative impairment previously recognised under IFRS 5 (or earlier under IAS 36) in respect of the assets within scope.<br>• For disposal groups any impairment loss (or subsequent gain) should be allocated to the non-current assets in the group that are within the scope of IFRS 5’s measurement rules. Allocation order: first reduce goodwill in the group (if any), then allocate remaining loss pro rata to other non-current assets within scope based on carrying amounts. Items outside measurement scope (e.g., certain financial assets, deferred tax) are not adjusted by IFRS 5 allocation.<br>• IFRS 5 is silent on the situation where required impairment exceeds carrying value of non-current assets within its measurement scope. Practice has followed alternative approaches (policy choices): (a) apply impairment to current assets in group, (b) apply impairment to non-current assets outside IFRS 5 scope, (c) recognise a separate liability, or (d) restrict impairment allocation to carrying value of assets within IFRS 5 scope. Entities must choose a policy, apply it consistently and disclose it. The IASB considered this issue but (as of the chapter’s drafting) did not amend IFRS 5. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2.4 Presentation in the statement of financial position of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale</strong><br><strong>Presentation requirements</strong><br>• Non-current assets classified as held for sale and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale must be presented separately from other assets in the statement of financial position.<br>• Liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale must be presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.<br>• Assets and liabilities held for sale must not be offset and presented as single net amount. Major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale should generally be separately disclosed either on the face of the statement or in the notes, except where the disposal group is a newly acquired subsidiary that met held-for-sale on acquisition (in which case some illustrations exempt detailed separate disclosure).<br>• Any cumulative income or expense recognised directly in other comprehensive income relating to a non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for sale should be presented separately (either on the face or in notes) to allow users to identify amounts that will be recognised upon disposal. IFRS 5 implementation guidance illustrates a caption for "Amounts recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to non-current assets held for sale".<br><strong>Practical presentation approaches</strong><br>• Common practice: show held-for-sale non-current assets within current assets, on dedicated separate lines or groups, rather than only in notes. Simply noting an asset as held for sale in the notes without separate presentation on the face is not compliant. When classification first occurs, comparative statement of financial position is not re-presented. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>2.2.5 Changes to a plan of sale or to a plan of distribution</strong><br><strong>2.2.5.A Assets or disposal groups to be retained by the entity</strong><br>• If criteria for held-for-sale cease to be met, the asset/disposal group ceases to be classified as held for sale. If an individual asset/liability is removed from a disposal group, reassess whether the remaining group still meets held-for-sale criteria. If not, measure remaining items individually and reclassify as appropriate.<br>• Measurement on ceasing classification: measure the asset at the lower of (a) its carrying amount before classification as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation/amortisation and revaluations that would have been recognised had it not been classified as held for sale, and (b) its recoverable amount at the date of the decision not to sell (recoverable amount = higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss from continuing operations in the period criteria cease to be met, except where prior revaluation treatment applies (in which case revaluation accounting applies). If the asset was a subsidiary, joint operation, joint venture or associate, financial statements for periods since classification must be amended accordingly—IAS 28 requires retrospective amendment for associates and joint ventures from original classification date. Entities must disclose effects on results and prior period adjustments. <br><strong>2.2.5.B Change in method of disposal</strong><br>• Changing disposal method from sale to distribution to owners or vice versa is treated as continuation of original disposal plan. Do not reverse IFRS 5 accounting at that date; instead apply presentation and measurement requirements applicable to the new disposal method. Date of initial classification remains unchanged, and exceptions to the one-year rule may still be relevant. Recognise changes in fair value less costs to sell or distribute per impairment and reversal rules. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>3 Discontinued operations</strong><br><strong>3.1 Definition of a discontinued operation</strong><br>• Discontinued operation = a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that either:<br> (a) represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or<br> (b) is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or<br> (c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.<br>• A "component of an entity" is operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity (i.e., a CGU or group of CGUs when held for use). The adjective “major” applies to both line of business and geographical area; judgment, rationale and disclosures are required under IAS 1 when determining "major". A single co-ordinated plan can permit piecemeal disposals; parts sold within 12 months will be presented as discontinued for the period in which they meet held-for-sale criteria. Abandonment triggers discontinued operation treatment only when use actually ceases. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>3.2 Presentation of discontinued operations</strong><br><strong>Face-of-statement presentation</strong><br>• Present a single amount on the face of the statement of comprehensive income that comprises:<br> (a) the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations, and<br> (b) the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) comprising the discontinued operation.<br>• Provide further analysis (either on face or in notes) into: (i) revenue, expenses and pre-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations; (ii) the gain or loss on measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal; and (iii) the related income tax expense amounts for each of (i) and (ii). The detailed analysis is not required for disposal groups that are newly acquired subsidiaries that met held-for-sale on acquisition.<br><strong>Attribution and comparative presentation</strong><br>• Disclose amounts of income from continuing operations and discontinued operations attributable to owners of the parent. IFRS 5 requires re-presentation of prior periods’ disclosures so that the financial statements reflect all operations that have been discontinued by the reporting date for the latest period presented. This means adjustments to comparative periods’ presentation of discontinued operations. <br><strong>Adjustments related to prior discontinued disposals</strong><br>• Current period adjustments directly related to disposal of a discontinued operation in a prior period (e.g., purchase price adjustments, indemnities, settlement of retained obligations such as warranties or employee benefit liabilities) should be classified separately in discontinued operations with nature and amount disclosed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>3.2.1 Cash flows attributable to discontinued operations</strong><br>• Disclose net cash flows attributable to operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations either on the face of the cash flow statement or in the notes. Disposal groups that are newly acquired subsidiaries held for sale on acquisition are exempt from this disclosure.<br>• IFRS 5 does not explicitly state whether proceeds from disposal are attributable to discontinued or continuing operations; entities have a policy choice and must disclose it. Consider separate line for disposal proceeds in the cash flow statement if material. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>3.3 Trading between continuing and discontinued operations</strong><br><strong>Consolidation and elimination requirements</strong><br>• Discontinued operations remain consolidated until disposal; intragroup transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are eliminated in consolidation per IFRS 10 (IFRS 5 does not override IFRS 10). IFRS IC agenda decision (Jan 2016) emphasised that eliminating intragroup income and expenses is required by consolidation rules and that IFRS 5’s disclosure objective may require additional information when eliminations mask economic effects.<br><strong>Presentation alternatives and policy choices</strong><br>• Two practical approaches to elimination of intragroup transactions between continuing and discontinued operations:<br> (1) eliminate all intragroup transactions without adjustments (strict consolidation elimination), resulting in continuing operations showing only transactions with external parties; or<br> (2) eliminate intragroup transactions but make adjustments to present how transactions will be reflected in continuing operations going forward (i.e., adjust eliminated balances to show expected future continuing impact).<br>• IFRS IC noted that failure to eliminate intragroup transactions is inconsistent with IFRS 10; entities may choose approach (2) if it provides more useful information, but must apply chosen policy consistently and provide additional disclosures if intra-group transactions are significant. Illustrative example (Group X with Entity A selling components to Entity B) demonstrates different profit splits under alternatives. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>4 Comparative information</strong><br><strong>4.1 Treatment of comparative information on initial classification as held for sale</strong><br><strong>4.1.1 Statement of comprehensive income</strong><br>• For assets/disposal groups not qualifying as discontinued operations there is no special requirement to restate comparative income statement amounts. When a component becomes a discontinued operation, present a separate disclosure of its total results and re-present prior periods presented so that discontinued operation disclosures relate to all operations discontinued by the reporting date for the latest period (IFRS 5 requires re-presentation of prior-period discontinued disclosures).<br><strong>4.1.2 Statement of financial position</strong><br>• Do not reclassify or re-present amounts in prior periods’ statements of financial position to reflect held-for-sale classification in the latest period; comparatives remain as originally presented. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>4.2 Treatment of comparative information on the cessation of classification as held for sale</strong><br>• When classification as held for sale ceases, remeasure the asset at the lower of: (a) the carrying amount before classification, adjusted for depreciation/amortisation and revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale, and (b) its recoverable amount at the date of the decision not to sell (recoverable amount = higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Recognise the adjustment in profit or loss from continuing operations in the period the criteria cease to be met, unless the asset was revalued prior to classification (apply revaluation accounting in that case).<br>• Financial statements for periods since classification must be amended where the asset/disposal group that ceased to be held for sale was a subsidiary, joint operation, joint venture, associate, or portion of an interest in JV/associate. IAS 28 clarifies that for associates and joint ventures amendment is retrospective from the date of original classification as held for sale; practice and IFRS 5 language indicate retrospective amendment for measurement and (in many cases) presentation where the ceased-to-be-held-for-sale item was an investee. When a component ceases to be classified as held for sale but was presented as discontinued, results previously presented as discontinued should be reclassified back into continuing operations for all periods presented. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>5 Disclosure requirements</strong><br><strong>5.1 Requirements of IFRS 5</strong><br>• Overarching disclosure objective: present and disclose information enabling users to evaluate financial effects of discontinued operations and disposals of non-current assets or disposal groups.<br>• In the period in which an asset/disposal group is classified as held for sale or sold, disclose in the notes: a description of the non-current asset or disposal group; facts and circumstances leading to the sale or expected disposal; expected manner and timing of disposal; the gain or loss recognised on measuring the asset/disposal group at fair value less costs to sell and, if not separately presented on the face of the statement of comprehensive income, the caption that includes that gain or loss; and, if applicable, the operating segment per IFRS 8 in which the asset/disposal group is reported.<br>• If classification occurs after the reporting date but before authorisation for issue, disclose the items above. If classification ceases or an individual asset/liability is removed from a disposal group, disclose facts and circumstances and the effect on results for the period and any prior periods presented. Disclose net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations’ operating, investing and financing activities (face or notes).<br><strong>Practical examples</strong><br>• The chapter reproduces practical disclosure examples from real companies (e.g., Siemens 2021 and ENGIE 2021 extracts) illustrating how entities disclose descriptions, results, segment presentation and cash flows for discontinued operations. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>5.2 Disclosures required by standards other than IFRS 5</strong><br>• Disclosures required by other IFRS standards do not apply to assets/disposal groups classified as held for sale or to discontinued operations unless that standard specifically requires disclosures in respect of held for sale/discontinued operations, or requires disclosures about measurement of items in a disposal group that are outside IFRS 5 measurement scope.<br>• IFRS 12 (Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) applies to interests classified as held for sale, except where IFRS 12 explicitly exempts particular summarised information. IAS 1 requirements on fair presentation and estimation uncertainty (including IAS 1.117–122) may require disclosure of significant judgements and accounting policy choices made when applying IFRS 5 — examples: whether IFRS 5 is applied to all losses of control, how excess impairment is allocated, elimination policy for intragroup balances, and treatment of deferred taxes in disposal groups. Entities should ensure cross-reference to other-standard disclosures where relevant (e.g., IAS 36, IAS 16, IAS 28). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>6 Possible future developments</strong><br><strong>Items considered by IASB and IFRS IC</strong><br>• Topics raised and considered for potential standard-level actions include: scope of held-for-sale classification (including deemed disposals and loss of control nuances), accounting for disposal groups consisting mainly of financial instruments, the “excess impairment” issue (impairment allocation where required loss exceeds carrying amounts within IFRS 5 scope), reversal of goodwill impairments in disposal groups, allocation of impairments within disposal groups, definition and disclosures for discontinued operations including the meaning of “major”, presentation of OCI related to disposal groups, rules for intragroup transactions between continuing and discontinued operations, applicability of IFRS 12 to subsidiaries classified held for sale, and presentation where a disposal group includes a subsidiary plus other assets.<br><strong>Board activity and status</strong><br>• The IASB/IFRS IC discussed multiple IFRS 5 issues; some were referred to IFRS IC (e.g., intragroup transactions). The IASB considered but did not prioritise some amendments in December 2009 and subsequently sought broader feedback. Post-implementation reviews of IFRS 13 (completed Dec 2018) and IFRS 10–12 (completed Jun 2022) were completed; the IASB’s 2015 consultation and the 2021 third agenda consultation gathered mixed feedback on IFRS 5 matters and, as of the chapter, a dedicated IFRS 5 project had not been added to the immediate work plan. Future revision remains possible but timing and scope are uncertain; entities should monitor IASB/IFRS IC developments and disclose significant judgements in the interim. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Chapter 4 — Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations"> <strong>Appendix A — Index of Illustrations</strong><br>• Illustrations referenced include: deferred tax liability on remeasurement of investment property held for sale; timing of reclassification to held for sale; meaning of “available for immediate sale”; shareholders’ approval examples; exceptions to the one-year rule; measuring and presenting subsidiaries acquired with a view to sale; allocation of impairment loss within a disposal group; presenting non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale; discontinued operation arising from abandonment; operations ceasing gradually; administrative activities ongoing while discontinued; presenting discontinued operations; elimination of intragroup transactions between continuing and discontinued operations.

Perform cost/benefit analysis and seek auditor/regulator input for material items.<br><strong>Judgement and documentation</strong><br>• <strong>Document everything</strong> — contemporaneous documentation for judgements (completed contracts, discount rates, asset valuations) is crucial for auditability and regulatory review. Maintain a sign-off trail. <br><strong>Tax complexities</strong><br>• <strong>Deferred tax mapping</strong> — transition adjustments often create complex tax consequences. Early involvement of tax specialists is essential to avoid late surprises. Document tax bases and provide illustrative journal entries for tax effects. <br><strong>Systems and controls</strong><br>• <strong>Operational readiness</strong> — IFRS adoption often requires ERP changes, new control points (lease registers, contract repositories) and training for accounting teams. Build a post-adoption control plan. <br><strong>Disclosure depth and stakeholder needs</strong><br>• <strong>Be pragmatic but transparent</strong> — IFRS 1 does not require exhaustive listing of all exemptions used, but best practice is to disclose the major elections and their quantitative effects.
