Purpose</strong><br>• The NGO receives and manages funding in multiple currencies. This Foreign Currency Policy enables programme delivery while ensuring accurate, auditable reporting of expenditure in line with funder expectations.<br>• The core policy text is the mandatory policy. Notes and Annexes provide guidance and do NOT form part of the Policy. Notes and Annexes may be updated from time to time, as approved by the CFO or authorised governance body.<br><strong>Expanded purpose and scope (guidance & examples):</strong><br>• Clarifies how currency conversions, accounting treatments, advances and reconciliations are handled to ensure consistency across operational units and between local systems and any central fund administrator.<br>• Example: when a USD grant funds in-country USD salaries and local-currency procurement, this Policy standardises how receipts are held, converted and reported, and how forex gains/losses are identified and recorded.<br>• Objectives: minimise unnecessary currency conversions, preserve accurate grant balances in the grant currency, ensure transparent advance usage, and provide a single source of truth for audits and funder inspections. Expected outcomes include consistent month-end processes, auditable reconciliations within 30 days of month-end, and documented exception handling. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>2. Who this policy applies to?</strong><br>• <strong>2.1</strong> This policy applies to the NGO and its operational units (for example: Unit A, Unit B, Unit C, Unit D). Collectively “the Organisation”.<br>• <strong>2.2</strong> Applies to all staff, temporary personnel and third parties who incur expenditure or liabilities, make or receive grants, or contribute to financial reporting to funders or to the Organisation’s central finance function.<br>• <strong>2.3</strong> Applies to all activities and grants administered via the Organisation and to on-behalf arrangements with partner institutions where the Organisation has reporting responsibilities.<br><strong>Applicability and exceptions:</strong><br>• Applies to Project Administrators, Finance Officers, Heads of Unit, Project Leads, Procurement staff, and field staff with delegated financial authority.<br>• Temporary staff & consultants issued an advance, petty cash, or authorised to make payments must comply, including timely submission of receipts and reconciliations.<br>• Exceptions: legal or regulatory requirements that prevent compliance must be treated as exceptions; such exceptions require prior written approval from Head of Finance and CFO and must be logged in an Exceptions Log. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>3. Background</strong><br>• <strong>3.1</strong> The Organisation receives funding both directly from funders and via central partners or administrators. Funding commonly arrives in major currencies (USD, GBP, EUR) and in local currencies as required.<br>• <strong>3.2</strong> Multiple currencies, jurisdictions and systems create complexity. This Policy sets out principles and rules for consistent management of that complexity.<br><strong>Context and examples:</strong><br>• Funding types: core grants, project grants, contracts, commercial income. Each source may have different currency, schedule and reporting rules (e.g., central partner receives EUR while local payments require local currency and other regional currencies).<br>• Systems interaction: local multicurrency systems hold transactional detail while some central partner systems are single-currency for statutory consolidation. Reconciling advances across systems is addressed by Central Advance Rate and fixed translation mechanics (see Annexes). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>4. For grants administered via a central partner / fund administrator</strong><br>• <strong>4.1</strong> Expenditure may be incurred locally and/or processed by a central partner/fund administrator.<br>• <strong>4.2</strong> Local expenditure is recorded in the Organisation’s local multicurrency finance system.<br>• <strong>4.3</strong> Expenditure processed by a central partner may be recorded in a single-currency central system. Monthly reporting from local systems to the central system is required for combined reporting to funders.<br>• <strong>4.4</strong> Central administrators may provide advances in the currency of the grant or convert to their reporting currency per their policy. If funding arrives in another currency, discuss pass-through options with the central administrator.<br><strong>Operational notes (example monthly workflow):</strong><br>1. Local finance posts transactions using transaction date and bank spot rate where applicable.<br>2. At month end, unit produces grant-level reports in grant currency.<br>3. Apply Monthly Rate translations for consolidated reporting.<br>4. Prepare Advance Reconciliation schedule showing advances received (Central Advance Rate / fixed translation as applicable), advances spent and balances to clear.<br>5. Submit consolidated pack to central partner’s research accounting by agreed deadline. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>5. Central administration’s foreign currency approach for externally administered grants</strong><br>• Central partners commonly manage FX gains/losses centrally and may set a fixed translation rate for a grant’s lifetime to provide budget certainty. Where the Organisation administers grants in the grant currency, exceptions may be agreed to allow local reporting in that currency.<br><strong>Clarifications and examples:</strong><br>• Fixed translation example: a $100,000 award with fixed translation rate 0.80 results in a central reporting currency budget of 80,000 units for the grant life. Central treasury manages net FX exposure; project teams retain operational certainty under the fixed rate.<br>• Flow-through example: the Organisation receives USD funds for USD-priced reagents, manages funds in USD bank accounts and reports to funders in USD while translating to the central currency for central reporting using Central Advance Rate / fixed translation rules.<br>• Conflict management: transactions generating material statutory differences must be documented and reported monthly to central finance and CFO. Default materiality threshold: 1% of grant budget or USD 50,000 (adjustable by CFO). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>6. Principles which guide this policy</strong><br>• <strong>6.1 Key principles:</strong><br>  – Timely, accurate reports for Directors, Committees, Project Leads, partners and funders.<br>  – Minimise unnecessary currency conversions between invoice/expenditure currency and grant currency to meet funder expectations.<br>  – Reconcile advances to/from central partners and other funders.<br>  – Allow central finance oversight of reconciliations while keeping operational responsibility local where appropriate.<br>  – Comply with local regulatory reporting; local regulation takes precedence where conflicts exist.<br>  – Maintain transparent audit trails from source documents to funder reports and advances.<br>  – Record transactions in classifications that support funder and internal management reporting.<br>• <strong>6.2 Secondary principles:</strong><br>  – Minimise manual calculations via system configuration.<br>  – Standardise processes across units to reduce variance between central and local accounting. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>6 — Checklist & decision rules:</strong><br>1. Verify bank reconciliations for all currency accounts are completed and signed off.<br>2. Confirm Monthly Rate applied to outstanding invoices and posted consistently.<br>3. Confirm Central Advance Rate / fixed translation applied correctly to advance clearings and central mapping reconciled.<br>4. Log and approve exceptions via CFO.<br>Decision rules (examples): if invoice currency = grant currency → pay from that bank account where available. If no account and cost < petty cash threshold → pay locally and document conversion. If cost > $10,000 and no account → escalate to Head of Finance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>7. Risks</strong><br>• <strong>7.1</strong> The Organisation must reconcile advances and provide funder reports accurately and timely.<br>• <strong>7.2</strong> Failure to meet reporting requirements or maintain controls may lead to funding suspension or reputational risk.<br><strong>Risk register examples & mitigations:</strong><br>• Unreconciled advances → Monthly advance reconciliation, independent review by Head of Financial Reporting.<br>• Excessive conversions → Prefer grant currency for contracts/advances; CFO approval for exceptions; maintain conversion log.<br>• Regulatory transfer restrictions → Maintain legal/treasury contact list and contingency bank arrangements; update Annexes when changes occur. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>8. Currency of grant applications</strong><br>• <strong>8.1</strong> Apply for grants in the currency that best matches expected expenditure where funders allow (e.g., USD for USD-denominated costs).<br>• <strong>8.2</strong> Where budget items are in a different currency, conversion rates used shall be from a reputable source, use prior month-end or a reasonable average (e.g., up to 12 months), be acceptable to funders, and be documented with source and date.<br>• <strong>8.3</strong> Engage Finance early where significant spend in another currency is anticipated to agree translation methods.<br>• <strong>8.4</strong> Applications with significant FX risk or value require CFO and senior governance review before submission. Default significant value: > USD 1,000,000.<br>• <strong>8.5</strong> Project teams are primarily responsible for managing FX risk within approved budgets. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>8 — Worked examples:</strong><br>• Local budget → USD grant: convert using prior month-end bank rate or 12-month average; document source; include contingency (2–5% recommended).<br>• Mixed currency costs: present split budgets and reconciliation schedule; include sensitivity analysis +/-5% exchange rate. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>9. Sub-contracting to Collaborators / Partners</strong><br>• <strong>9.1</strong> All funding to collaborators and partners must be governed by a written agreement.<br>• <strong>9.2</strong> Agreements should generally be denominated in the grant currency unless exemptions apply (local law requires local currency; funder underwrites FX risk; or CFO approves alternative currency).<br>• <strong>9.3</strong> Physical transfer of advances should be in the grant currency where practicable; exceptions require Head of Finance / CFO approval and must be documented.<br>• <strong>9.4</strong> Budget schedules must document FX assumptions and how potential gains/losses and FX risks will be managed. Existing sub-contracts that do not comply are exceptions and will not be restated. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>9 — Contract clauses & workflow:</strong><br>• Recommended clause: “Payments to the Partner shall be made in [grant currency]. If local law requires payments in local currency, the Partner shall document bank confirmation of conversion rates applied and return any unspent amounts in the grant currency.”<br>• Partner advance workflow example: Agreement specifies grant currency; advance made to partner’s account in that currency where possible; partner uses funds; reconciles and returns unspent funds or documents conversions; Organisation reviews and certifies. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>10. Petty cash</strong><br>• <strong>10.1</strong> Move toward electronic payments; cash advances only where business need or local regulation requires.<br>• <strong>10.2</strong> Petty cash advances normally provided in major currencies (USD, GBP, EUR) or local currency for the operating unit, subject to local banking arrangements.<br>• <strong>10.3</strong> Petty cash may be provided to staff and approved collaborators; local limits and approval authorities apply.<br>• <strong>10.4</strong> Unspent advances must be returned in the currency of the advance; realised FX differences handled per local procedures with supporting documentation.<br>• <strong>10.5</strong> Advances in other currencies require Head of Finance and CFO approval. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>10 — Controls & examples:</strong><br>• Recommended petty cash limits: standard advance up to USD 200; travel advance up to USD 1,000 (requires Travel Request); fieldwork exceptions up to USD 2,000 with approval.<br>• Corporate prepaid cards preferred where feasible; card reconciliations follow same currency/documentation rules. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>11. Supplier Advances</strong><br>• Supplier advances must follow applicable funder and central partner rules. Where central reporting requires advances to be expensed on payment, local teams must note this in management packs and seek exceptions only with CFO approval.<br><strong>Operational checklist:</strong><br>• Advance request must include supplier name, reason, contract reference, amount & currency, bank details, expected delivery, and evidence of supplier creditworthiness.<br>• Accounting treatment (local preferred): record advance as an asset; where central rules require expensing on payment, post corresponding central expenditure entries and reconcile on delivery with supplier invoice.<br>• Controls: two authorised signatories for advances above USD 5,000; procurement approval and supplier advance register with milestone tracking. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>12. Advances from central funder (“Funding currency”)</strong><br>• Central partners may provide advances in grant currency or convert to their reporting currency using a fixed translation rate for the grant life. The central partner manages FX risk between reporting and grant currencies.<br>• Units convert funding currency into local bank accounts for payments as required (pooled method). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>12 — Pooled method & reconciliation:</strong><br>1. Central partner issues advance in grant or reporting currency.<br>2. Organisation records advance using Central Advance Rate (CAR) provided by central partner; maintain advance register showing original currency, CAR, date and amount.<br>3. Convert part of advance to local currency at bank spot rate when required; record supporting bank evidence.<br>4. Month-end FIFO clearance: apply CAR to the portion of advance being cleared to match central records; post clearing journal and update register. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>13. Which Bank Account to use?</strong><br>• Use the bank account matching the invoice/payment currency where possible.<br>• Exceptions:<br>  a) <strong>Advances</strong> – travel/staff advances may be provided in the most convenient currency for recipient, subject to local rules.<br>  b) <strong>Petty cash</strong> – provided in authorised currencies for the unit.<br>  c) <strong>Invoice currency not held</strong> – use account that minimises the number of conversions (prefer grant currency account if available).<br>  d) <strong>Other</strong> – as approved by Head of Finance / CFO. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>13 — Decision matrix & example:</strong><br>• If invoice currency = available bank account → use that account. If invoice currency not held & invoice < petty cash threshold → petty cash/card. If invoice ≥ threshold → select account minimising conversions (document rationale). Example: invoice in SGD, grant in USD, no SGD account → pay from USD account (single conversion USD→SGD) and document bank spot rate and rationale. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>14. Roles and Responsibilities</strong><br>• Executive Committee approves policy changes.<br>• Project Leads / Grant Applicants must follow policy or seek documented exemptions if compliance materially impedes delivery.<br>• CFO approves one-off exceptions.<br>• CFO / Finance Committee approve Annexes and Procedures implementing this Policy.<br>• Heads of Finance ensure local processes align with the Policy and are kept up to date.<br>• Contact Head of Finance or CFO for guidance if in doubt. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>14 — Detailed responsibilities & escalation:</strong><br>• Project Lead: ensure budgeting complies; approve project exceptions; review monthly grant reports.<br>• Project Administrator: prepare grant documentation; forward receipts within 7 working days; maintain exchange rate evidence.<br>• Head of Finance: authorise currency choices above thresholds; sign off reconciliations; escalate material exposures to CFO.<br>• CFO: approve policy exceptions; sign off major currency/contract decisions; own policy change control.<br>• Escalation: routine issues resolved by Project Administrator; material issues (> USD 5,000 unexplained) escalated to Head of Finance and CFO per defined timelines; policy exception requests submitted to CFO with business case. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>15. Definitions</strong><br>• <strong>Local multicurrency finance system</strong> – Organisation’s system for recording multi-currency transactions.<br>• <strong>Central finance system</strong> – single-currency system used by a central partner for statutory reporting.<br>• <strong>Central Partner / Central Administrator</strong> – external partner or fund administrator that processes or holds advances and provides consolidated reporting.<br>• <strong>Policy</strong> – high-level mandatory rules approved by governance.<br>• <strong>Processes / Procedures</strong> – operational steps and checklists implementing the Policy.<br>• <strong>Fixed translation rate (X-rate)</strong> – translation mechanism sometimes applied by central partners to fix a grant’s budget in their reporting currency for the grant lifetime. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>15 — Technical mappings:</strong><br>• <strong>Central Advance Rate (CAR):</strong> rate provided by central partner to record advances in the central system; used to align local advance postings with central balances.<br>• <strong>Monthly Rate:</strong> unit-specific rate used to translate transactions for reporting; typically from bank feeds or treasury publications.<br>• <strong>Spot Rate:</strong> actual bank rate at time of payment; used to record bank transactions and reconcile statements.<br>• <strong>Grant currency:</strong> currency in which the funder issues the award and expects reporting. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>16.

Reconcile both monthly and explain material differences. Ensure communication channels with central partner for any required reclassifications. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="NGO Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>Annex C — Budget translation & treasury considerations</strong><br>• Use agreed translation method during proposal costing where central partner sets a budget rate. Document translation rates in agreements.<br>• For large projects (> threshold, e.g., central currency 1,000,000), consider treasury / hedging options with central partner/treasury involvement.

Purpose</strong><br>• Funding is often multicurrency; this Foreign Currency Policy enables programme delivery while ensuring accurate, auditable reporting of expenditure in line with Funders’ expectations.<br>• The policy text is the core Policy. Notes and Annexes provide guidance and do NOT form part of the Policy. Notes and Annexes may be updated from time to time, as approved by the CFO or authorised governance body.<br><strong>Expanded purpose and scope of use (guidance & examples):</strong><br>• This Policy clarifies how currency conversions, accounting treatments, advances and reconciliations are handled to ensure consistency across Units and between Local systems and any central fund administrator. It provides mandatory operational steps for finance teams, project managers and Project Leads.<br>• Example: when a USD grant funds in-country USD salaries and local-currency procurement, this Policy standardizes whether and how those USD receipts are held, converted and reported, and how resultant forex gains/losses are identified and recorded.<br>• Practical objective: minimise unnecessary currency conversions, preserve accurate grant balances in the grant currency, protect transparency of advance usage, and provide a single source of truth for audits and funder inspections.<br>• Expected outcomes: consistent month-end processes across Units, auditable reconciliations of advances within 30 days of month-end, and documented exception handling. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>2. Who this policy applies to?</strong><br>• <strong>2.1</strong> This policy applies to the Organisation and its operational Units (for example: Unit A, Unit B, Unit C, Unit D). These will be collectively referred to as “the Organisation”.<br>• <strong>2.2</strong> This policy applies to all employees and other individuals engaged on a temporary basis who incur expenditure or liabilities, make or receive grants, or otherwise contribute to financial reporting to Funders or to the Organisation’s central finance function.<br>• <strong>2.3</strong> For the avoidance of doubt this applies to all activities and grants administered via the Organisation and to on-behalf arrangements with partner institutions where the Organisation has reporting responsibilities.<br><strong>Expanded detail on applicability and exceptions:</strong><br>• Applies equally to Project Administrators, Finance Officers, Heads of Unit, Project Leads, Procurement staff, and field staff with delegated financial authority.<br>• Temporary staff & consultants: any person issued an advance, petty cash, or authorised to make payments on behalf of the Organisation must comply with this Policy, including submission of receipts and reconciliation within defined timescales.<br>• Exceptions: statutory or local regulatory rules that legally prevent compliance with any provision must be treated as exceptions; such exceptions require prior written approval from the Head of Finance and the CFO, and must be logged in the Annexes Exception Log.<br>• Cross-border projects administered outside the Organisation but funded by its grants: this Policy applies to financial flows from the Organisation to those projects. Where legal entities outside the Organisation receive funds directly from a central partner, those entities must follow local rules while the Organisation ensures reporting consistency. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>3. Background</strong><br>• <strong>3.1</strong> The Organisation receives funding both directly from Funders and via central partners or administrators. Funding commonly arrives in major convertible currencies (e.g., USD, GBP, EUR) and sometimes in local currencies (e.g., VND, IDR, NPR).<br>• <strong>3.2</strong> Managing multiple currencies across countries and systems creates complexity. This Policy sets out principles and rules for consistent management of that complexity.<br><strong>Expanded background — context and examples of complexity:</strong><br>• Multiple funding sources: core grants, project grants, capacity-building awards, contracts and commercial income. Each source may have different currency, payment schedule and reporting rules. Example: a consortium award may be paid in EUR to a central partner but require payments to local partners in local currency and to external labs in another regional currency.<br>• Systems interaction: Local multicurrency finance systems hold transactional detail while some central partner systems may be single-currency and used for statutory consolidation. Reconciling advances across these systems is a recurring complexity addressed by Central Advance Rate and fixed budget translation mechanics (see Annex B).<br>• Operational risk example: a Project Lead budgets travel in GBP for a UK visit but receives USD funding; failing to convert or approve in advance may expose the project to avoidable forex variation and procurement delays. This Policy standardizes advance currency decisions and escalation routes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>4. For grants administered via a central partner / fund administrator</strong><br>• <strong>4.1</strong> Expenditure may be incurred locally by the Organisation and/or processed by a central partner or fund administrator.<br>• <strong>4.2</strong> Local expenditure is recorded in the Organisation’s local multicurrency finance system.<br>• <strong>4.3</strong> Expenditure processed by a central partner may be recorded in a single-currency central finance system. Where this occurs, monthly reporting from local systems to the central system is required to enable combined reporting to Funders.<br>• <strong>4.4</strong> Central administrators may provide advances in the currency of the grant (typically USD, GBP or EUR) or convert to their reporting currency as per their policy. Where funding arrives in another currency, options for pass-through funding in that currency should be discussed with the central administrator.<br><strong>Expanded operational notes and step-by-step process:</strong><br>• Monthly reporting workflow (example): (1) Local finance posts all transactions in the local system using transaction date and local spot rate; (2) At month end, the Unit produces grant-level reports in grant currency; (3) Apply Monthly Rate translations for consolidated reporting; (4) Prepare Advance Reconciliation schedule showing advances received (Central Advance Rate / X-rate as applicable), advances spent, and balance to clear; (5) Submit consolidated pack to the central partner’s research accounting by the agreed reporting deadline.<br>• Example journal mapping (Local system → Central system): Local expenses recorded in the multicurrency system are translated to grant currency using Monthly Rate; export includes ledger codes that map to central project codes; central system receives equivalent values via predefined interface translating grant currency using agreed fixed translation rules where required.<br>• Practical example: USD grant advance of $50,000 received by Unit A. Unit A deposits USD into a USD bank account; USD salaries paid in USD and local procurement paid by converting USD to local currency. Unit records actual bank spot conversion rates in its system and reconciles against central advance rate/fixed translation rate when reporting to the central partner. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>5. Central administration’s foreign currency approach for externally administered grants</strong><br>• Central administrators often manage foreign-exchange gains and losses centrally and may fix a translation rate for the life of a grant to provide budget certainty to implementing teams. Where the Organisation administers grants in the grant currency, exceptions may be agreed to allow local reporting in that currency. Conflicts between accurate project reporting for Funders and central statutory reporting should be minimised and reported to central finance.<br><strong>Expanded clarifications and examples:</strong><br>• Fixed translation mechanism illustrated: A $100,000 USD award when fixed X-rate = 0.80 results in a central system GBP budget of £80,000 for the life of the grant. If during the project the GBP/USD spot moves, the central treasury manages net FX exposure; Project Leads retain the fixed central budget but the Organisation must ensure grant-level reports in USD match funder expectations.<br>• Flow-through scenario example: Organisation receives USD funds for reagents purchased in USD. The Organisation manages these funds in USD bank accounts and reports expenditure to Project Leads and Funders in USD, while translating to the central currency for central reporting using Central Advance Rate / X-rate rules. This preserves funder reporting fidelity without exposing central statutory accounts to unmanaged FX volatility.<br>• Conflict management: any transaction generating material statutory differences (e.g., repeated multi-currency conversions that create large net FX differences in the central system) must be documented, justified, and reported in the monthly exception report to central finance and the CFO. Materiality threshold is defined in Annexes (default: 1% of grant budget or USD 50,000; adjustable by CFO). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>6. Principles which guide this policy</strong><br>• <strong>6.1 Key principles:</strong><br>  – Provide timely, accurate reports to Directors, Executive Committees, Project Leads, local partners, Funders and other stakeholders for decision making.<br>  – Ensure Funders’ reporting expectations are met by minimising unnecessary currency conversions between invoice/expenditure currency and grant currency.<br>  – Enable reconciliation of advances to/from central partners and other funders.<br>  – Allow central finance oversight of reconciliations while leaving operational responsibility locally where appropriate.<br>  – Comply with local regulatory reporting requirements; where local rules conflict with this policy, local regulation takes precedence.<br>  – Ensure transparent audit trails from source documents to funder reports and advances.<br>  – Record transactions in classifications that support both funder and internal management reporting (e.g., Funders/Grant, Central admin, Local management codes).<br>• <strong>6.2 Secondary principles:</strong><br>  – Minimise manual calculations and adjustments through system configuration.<br>  – Standardise processes across Units to reduce variance in accounting treatment between central and local funding.<br><strong>Expanded principle application and checklist:</strong><br>• Principle checklist for month-end:<br>  1. Verify bank reconciliations for all currency accounts completed and signed off.<br>  2. Confirm Monthly Rate applied to all outstanding invoices and posted consistently.<br>  3. Confirm Central Advance Rate / X-rate applied correctly to advance clearings and central mapping reconciled.<br>  4. Confirm any exceptions logged and approved by CFO.<br>• Decision rules (examples): If invoice currency = grant currency → pay from bank account in that currency where available. If no bank account in invoice currency and cost < petty cash threshold → pay in local currency and document conversion. If cost > $10,000 and no bank account → escalate to Head of Finance for approval of bank choice and forex approach. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>7. Risks</strong><br>• <strong>7.1</strong> It is essential the Organisation can reconcile advances and provide Funders with accurate and timely reports.<br>• <strong>7.2</strong> Failure to meet Funders’ reporting requirements or to maintain adequate controls may result in funding being withheld or reputational risk.<br><strong>Expanded risk assessment, mitigation and sample risk register entries:</strong><br>• Key risks and mitigations:<br>  – Risk: Unreconciled advances creating restatement risk in central accounts. Mitigation: Monthly advance reconciliation with Central Advance Rate evidence and independent review by Head of Financial Reporting.<br>  – Risk: Excessive currency conversions causing material forex variances. Mitigation: Use grant currency for contracts and advances where feasible; require CFO approval for exceptions; maintain log of conversions and reasons.<br>  – Risk: Local regulatory changes preventing transfers. Mitigation: Maintain local legal/treasury contact list and pre-approved contingency bank accounts; update Annexes when change occurs.<br>• Sample risk register entry:<br>  – ID: R-003<br>  – Risk: Supplier requires payment in a non-pooled currency but grant is in USD; conversion may create repeated forex adjustments.<br>  – Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium-High<br>  – Controls: Obtain supplier quote in grant currency where possible; Head of Finance to approve payment account choice and record rationale; monitor and report monthly to CFO. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>8. Currency of grant applications</strong><br>• <strong>8.1</strong> Where permitted by Funders, the Organisation will apply for grants in the currency that best matches expected expenditure to reduce FX exposure (e.g., USD where most costs are USD-denominated).<br>• <strong>8.2</strong> Where budget items are prepared in a different currency to the application currency, conversion rates used in proposals shall be:<br>  – From a reputable source;<br>  – Either the prior month-end rate or a reasonable average (e.g., up to 12-month average);<br>  – Acceptable to Funders;<br>  – Documented with source and date.<br>• <strong>8.3</strong> Project teams should engage Finance early where significant local-currency or central-currency spend is anticipated so funding and budget translation methods can be agreed.<br>• <strong>8.4</strong> Where an application or active grant carries significant FX risk or value, the CFO and senior governance should review and approve the approach prior to submission or commitment.<br>• <strong>8.5</strong> Project teams are primarily responsible for managing FX risk within approved budgets; organisational guidance should be followed to minimise exposure.<br><strong>Expanded guidance for budgeting and rate selection (worked examples):</strong><br>• Example 1: Budget created in local currency but applying for USD grant. Steps: (1) Convert local line items to USD using prior month-end bank rate or a 12-month average if local currency volatile; (2) Document source and date of the rate on the budget cover sheet; (3) Include contingency for forex differences (recommended 2–5% depending on risk); (4) If funder requires fixed exchange rate, note this in budget and seek CFO sign-off.<br>• Example 2: Application with mixed currency costs (staff in USD, equipment in GBP). Solution: Present budgets split by cost type and include a reconciliation schedule showing the currency conversion methodology and overall budget in application currency; append sensitivity analysis showing +/-5% exchange rate impact on budget. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>9. Sub-contracting to Collaborators / Partners</strong><br>• <strong>9.1</strong> All funding to collaborators and partners must be governed by a written agreement.<br>• <strong>9.2</strong> Agreements should generally be denominated in the grant currency, unless exemptions apply (local law requires local currency; Funders agree to underwrite FX risk; or an alternative currency better enables the activity with CFO approval).<br>• <strong>9.3</strong> Physical transfer of advances to partners should be made in the grant currency where practicable. Exceptions require approval by the CFO or delegated finance authority.<br>• <strong>9.4</strong> Budget schedules must document FX assumptions and how potential gains/losses or FX risks will be managed. Existing agreements that do not comply should be treated as exceptions and documented accordingly.<br><strong>Expanded contractual clauses and operational examples:</strong><br>• Recommended clause for agreements: “Payments to the Partner shall be made in [grant currency]. If local law requires payments in local currency, the Partner shall document bank confirmation of conversion rates applied and return any unspent amounts in the grant currency.”<br>• Example workflow for partner advance (USD grant, partner in Country X): (1) Agreement signed specifying USD payments; (2) Organisation makes USD advance to Partner’s USD bank account where possible; (3) Partner uses USD to pay suppliers in USD; (4) Partner returns unspent USD or exchanges and documents conversion rates; (5) Head of Finance reviews partner reconciliation and supporting documentation before certifying expenditure.<br>• Exception approval template: requestor must submit Business Case, Estimated FX Exposure, Proposed Mitigation (e.g., partner hedging, bank confirmation), Approval signature fields for Head of Finance and CFO, and a required review date. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>10. Petty cash</strong><br>• <strong>10.1</strong> The Organisation will reduce cash use and move toward electronic payments where possible; cash advances are permitted only where business need or local regulation requires.<br>• <strong>10.2</strong> Petty cash advances will normally be provided in major currencies (e.g., USD, GBP, EUR) or the local currency for the operating unit, subject to local banking arrangements and regulations.<br>• <strong>10.3</strong> Petty cash may be provided to staff and approved collaborators; local limits and approval authorities apply.<br>• <strong>10.4</strong> Unspent advances must be returned in the currency of the advance; staff will be reimbursed or charged for realised FX differences as per local procedures and supporting documentation.<br>• <strong>10.5</strong> If there is a requirement for advances in any currency other than those authorised, approval from the Head of Finance and CFO is required.<br><strong>Expanded petty cash controls, examples and templates:</strong><br>• Petty cash limit table (recommended):<br>  – Standard staff petty cash single advance: up to USD 200 (or local equivalent).<br>  – Travel advance (short trip): up to USD 1,000. Requires Travel Request Form signed by Project Lead.<br>  – Fieldwork exceptional petty cash: up to USD 2,000 with Head of Finance approval.<br>• Example petty cash transaction: Staff receives a travel advance of GBP 300 for UK travel. On return, staff submits travel receipts in GBP; if receipts total GBP 260, staff returns GBP 40 to finance. If staff paid incidental local items in local currency and has receipts in IDR, finance converts receipts using Monthly Rate and reconciles to GBP advance. Small forex differences under GBP 5 are absorbed by project; greater amounts are adjusted to project ledger with justification. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>11. Supplier Advances</strong><br>• For grants administered via a central partner, central rules may require advances to suppliers to be expensed on payment for central reporting purposes. Local teams must note central reporting rules in management packs and seek exceptions when required by local accounting practice.<br><strong>Expanded supplier advance policy and operational checklist:</strong><br>• Supplier advance request must include: Supplier name, reason for advance, contract reference, amount and currency, bank details, expected delivery date of goods/services, and evidence of supplier creditworthiness.<br>• Example accounting treatment (local practice preferred):<br>  – When advance paid: record Advance to Supplier (asset) in local system in bank currency; if central partner rule requires expensing on payment, also post an expenditure entry for central reporting using Central Advance Rate / X-rate as required; reconcile asset to payment and clear on delivery with supplier invoice.<br>• Control steps: require two authorised signatories for supplier advances above USD 5,000; obtain procurement approval and a copy of contract; maintain supplier advance register with expected delivery milestone dates and evidence of follow-up. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>12. Advances from central funder (“Funding currency”)</strong><br>• Central partners or funders may provide advances in the currency of the grant for major currencies. For grants in other currencies, the central partner may convert the grant to their reporting currency, using a fixed translation rate that remains the same for the grant’s life. The central partner then manages forex risk between reporting currency and grant currency.<br>• Each Unit’s Head of Finance will convert funding currency into local currency bank accounts for payments as required. This is commonly implemented as a pooled method. <br><strong>Expanded pooled method and reconciliation guidance:</strong><br>• Pooled method detailed steps:<br>  1. Central partner issues advance in grant currency or in their reporting currency (if fixed rate applies).<br>  2. Organisation records the advance using the Central Advance Rate provided by the central partner to link the advance to central balances. Maintain an advance register showing original currency, Central Advance Rate, date and amount.<br>  3. When local currency payments are required, Head of Finance may convert part of advance using bank spot rate to local currency bank. Record conversion transaction and supporting bank evidence.<br>  4. At month end perform FIFO clearance: apply Central Advance Rate to the portion of advance being cleared to match central records; post clearing journal and update advance register.<br>• Example reconciliation: Central advance of €20,000. Organisation converts €10,000 to local currency at bank spot for local payment; local system records €10,000 as spent and local equivalent as expense. At month-end Organisation applies Central Advance Rate to reconcile €10,000 to central advance clearing and posts forex gain/loss on remaining advance if required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>13. Which Bank Account to use?</strong><br>• Payments should be made from the bank account matching the invoice/payment currency where possible.<br>• Exceptions are:<br>  a) <strong>Advances</strong> – staff advances, especially travel advances, may be provided in the most convenient currency for the recipient, subject to local rules.<br>  b) <strong>Petty cash</strong> – petty cash shall be provided in the most convenient authorised currency for the operating unit.<br>  c) <strong>Invoice currency not held in bank accounts</strong> – use the account that minimises the number of currency conversions (ideally an account in the grant currency).<br>  d) <strong>Other situations</strong> – as approved by the Head of Finance or CFO.<br><strong>Expanded bank account decision matrix and examples:</strong><br>• Decision matrix (summary):<br>  – Invoice currency = bank account currency available → use that bank account. Reason: minimal conversions and transparent bank statement matching.<br>  – Invoice currency ≠ any bank account currency & invoice amount < petty cash threshold → local petty cash or corporate card as convenient.<br>  – Invoice currency ≠ any bank account currency & invoice amount ≥ petty cash threshold → use bank account that minimises number of conversions (prefer grant currency bank where possible) and document rationale.<br>• Example: invoice in SGD for lab supplies, grant in USD, Organisation holds USD and local accounts but no SGD account. Choice: pay from USD account (single conversion USD→SGD at bank spot) rather than local→USD→SGD. Document bank spot rate and rationale, include in payment approval. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>14.

System calculates and populates <code>LocalEquivalent</code> using MonthlyRate for reporting and posts invoice to the grant ledger in <code>GrantCurrency</code> as configured.<br>  – <strong>Payment processing:</strong> capture bank spot rate on payment line; post <code>BankSpotEquivalent</code> and record realised forex variance to the Realised Forex P&L account.<br>  – <strong>Realised/unreconciled variances:</strong> realised variances post at payment; unreconciled variances are flagged for Head of Finance for investigation and monthly reconciliation.<br>• <strong>Recommended controls:</strong><br>  – Rate source and upload control: require approved provider (bank/treasury feed), with auditable source attached to each monthly upload.<br>  – Advance linkages: ensure <code>AdvanceID</code> maps to an advance register to support FIFO clearing and CAR/X-rate application for central reporting.<br>  – Audit trail: capture <code>ExchangeRateType</code>, <code>ExchangeRateDate</code> and <code>BankReference</code> on every transaction to enable disclosure, reconciliations and funder reporting. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex A — Additional notes & worked examples</strong><br>• Worked example — Advance clearing and forex calculation:<br>  – Central advance: USD 50,000 on 1 March.<br>  – CAR provided by central partner = GBP 0.78 per USD.<br>  – Organisation spends USD 30,000 during March (bank spot conversions for local payments recorded where applicable).<br>  – For central reporting: apply CAR to USD 30,000 → GBP 23,400 cleared against central advance. Remaining central advance balance = GBP 13,000 (equivalent to USD 20,000 at CAR).<br>  – Any realised gains/losses from spot conversions are recorded locally and reconciled to CAR difference when clearing. Documentation: bank statements, local payment lines, monthly advance reconciliation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex B: Payment matrix</strong><br>• Categories: A. Invoice/credit card payment in local currency; B. Invoice/credit card payment in pooled (grant) currency; C. Invoice/credit card payment in non-pooled currency.<br><strong>Procedural steps for each category:</strong><br>• Category A — Local currency payments:<br>  – Use local currency bank account where invoice is in local currency.<br>  – Record transaction using Monthly Rate for grant reporting if applicable.<br>  – Example: local invoice paid from local account—no conversion required. If paid from foreign currency account, capture bank spot rate and record realised forex difference.<br>• Category B — Pooled account (grant currency) payments:<br>  – Use pooled account (USD/GBP/EUR) when invoice is in one of these currencies. Convert to local currency only when necessary for local suppliers or payroll. Maintain documentation of conversions.<br>• Category C — Non-pooled currency payments:<br>  – If invoice currency not held, choose bank account that minimises conversions and document rationale. Consider opening a bank account in recurring currencies if approved by Head of Finance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex B — Definitions of Rates & Usage (detailed)</strong><br><strong>[1] Pooled Account Spot Rate (Bank Spot Rate)</strong><br>• Bank spot rate applied when converting pooled currency advances into local currency for payment processing.<br>• Used to translate and calculate expenditure transaction amounts for clearing advances and recognising realised foreign exchange gains/losses. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>[2] Monthly Rate</strong><br>• Obtained from approved banks or treasury and input into the system by each Unit’s Financial Accounting Team.<br>• Used for expenditure reporting to Funders and internal management; system should translate invoices and payments using Monthly Rate where required.<br><strong>Validation and documentation:</strong><br>• Monthly Rates must be sourced from an agreed provider and uploaded by the 3rd working day of each month with auditable source retained. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>[3] Central Advance Rate (CAR)</strong><br>• Advance rate used by a central partner to recognise non-reporting-currency advances in the central system.<br>• Applied by the Organisation when consolidating expenditures across Units and when clearing central advances on a FIFO basis. Central partner communicates applicable CAR at the time of each advance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>[4] Fixed budget translation rate (X-rate)</strong><br>• Provided by central partners and fixed for the life of a grant in some arrangements.<br>• Applied when reporting to central systems by converting grant currency values into the central reporting currency using the X-rate where agreed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>[5] Transaction / Bank Spot Rate</strong><br>• Actual bank rate applied at the time of payment; varies daily and used to record the actual bank transaction and reconcile bank statements. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Realised vs. Unrealised Foreign Exchange Treatment</strong><br>• <strong>Realised forex gain/loss:</strong> arises when an actual bank conversion occurs (e.g., USD → local currency). Recognised in the realised forex P&L account at time of payment.<br>• <strong>Unrealised forex gain/loss:</strong> arises from translation differences at reporting dates (e.g., Monthly Rate vs Spot Rate). Recognised in accordance with local accounting policy.<br>• Unrealised balances must be reconciled monthly, with movements explained and disclosed in funder reports where required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex B — Notes & FAQs</strong><br>• FAQ: If a supplier issues an invoice in a currency different to the grant currency which should be used for reporting? Answer: Report in the grant currency for funder reports using Monthly Rate; record original invoice currency and amounts in the local system for audit trail.<br>• FAQ: How long to reconcile an advance? Answer: Reconciliation should be completed within 30 days of month end and certified by Head of Finance. Delays must be documented with an expected completion date. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex C: Central administration foreign currency approach — summary & key provisions</strong><br>• Many central administrators manage exchange risk centrally and may set budget translation rates to provide budget certainty; policies vary and should be reviewed when funds are administered centrally.<br><strong>Expanded operational implications and guidance:</strong><br>• Maintain parallel reporting streams where applicable: (a) Funder-facing reporting in grant currency; (b) Central-facing reporting applying CAR/X-rate. Ensure both streams are reconciled monthly and material differences explained.<br>• If the central partner requires reclassification or adjustments due to their policy, ensure communication channels are established to capture such reclassifications and explain impact to Project Leads and Project Administrators. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex C — 1. Budget translation on fixed rates</strong><br>• <strong>1.1 Application stage:</strong> Use the agreed budget translation method when pricing income where a central partner sets a budget rate. Request guidance from central finance where needed.<br>• <strong>1.2 Offer and contract stage:</strong> Document the translation rate used in grant agreements and budget documents. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex C — 2. Managing projects & reporting (general)</strong><br>• Financial reporting to Funders will follow agreed rates unless Funders require otherwise. Central partners may retain FX gains/losses centrally in line with their policy. Requests for exceptions (e.g., to apply actual rates) should be directed to central finance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex C — 3. Funders with prescribed reporting rates</strong><br>• For Funders that prescribe reporting rates or methods, follow Funders’ guidance for reporting periods and rates. Coordinate with Research/Grant Accounting as required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Annex C — 4. Spending in foreign currency from projects</strong><br>• If significant payments are expected in a particular foreign currency, engage finance early to ring-fence activity and plan payments to minimise FX exposure. Consider treasury or hedging options where appropriate and authorised. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>Notes / Closing procedural points</strong><br>• Annexes provide implementation detail and do not form part of the core Policy; changes to Annex material require CFO or delegated approval.<br>• Document code: [local code] — Version: [xx] — Effective: [date].<br><strong>Quick reference checklist for project setup:</strong><br>  1. Confirm grant currency and bank accounts available.<br>  2. Agree Monthly Rate source and document it in project folder.<br>  3. Record CAR/X-rate details if applicable and link to central project code.<br>  4. Determine petty cash and advance thresholds and authorisations.<br>  5.
