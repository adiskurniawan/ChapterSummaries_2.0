Purpose</strong><br>• Our funding is multicurrency and this Foreign Currency Policy shall enable the research objectives as well as accurately report expenditure in line with Grantors expectations.<br>• The policy is pages 1 to 6 only. Notes are included for guidance and do NOT form part of the Policy. Annexes provide further information and do NOT form part of the Policy. Notes and Annexes may be updated from time to time, as approved by the CFO. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>2. Who this policy applies to?</strong><br>• <strong>2.1</strong> This policy is applicable to the OUCRU Programme. For the purposes of this Policy this includes the following Units: OUCRU HN, OUCRU HCM, OUCRU ID and OUCRU NP. These will be collectively referred to as “OUCRU”.<br>• <strong>2.2</strong> This policy applies to all employees and other individuals engaged on a temporary basis, who are involved in incurring expenditure or liabilities, making and receiving grants that form any part of the reporting of OUCRU to Grantors and Oxford.<br>• <strong>2.3</strong> For the avoidance of doubt this applies to all activities and grants which are administered via OUCRU. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>3. Background</strong><br>• <strong>3.1</strong> OUCRU receives funding from both Grants administered by Oxford and also directly. The former is the majority of funding of which the most significant are the Wellcome core awards. Funding is mainly in USD, with GBP the second biggest currency and some is in Euro, VND, IDR, Australian Dollar and other currencies.<br>Note: Currently OUCRU NP do not receive any NPR grants but may do in the future.<br>• <strong>3.2</strong> This is complex given the number of countries and systems involved and this Policy aims to set out the principles and rules for managing this complexity. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>4. For grants administered by Oxford</strong><br>• <strong>4.1</strong> OUCRU expenditure is both locally incurred and by Oxford University (“Oxford”).<br>• <strong>4.2</strong> OUCRU incurred expenditure is accounted and reported using our local multicurrency finance system (“D365”).<br>Note: the current finance system, DAX, is being replaced with a new system (D365) for a go live in early 2023. All Units will then use this system.<br>• <strong>4.3</strong> Expenditure incurred directly by Oxford is accounted and reported using the Oxford finance system (“Oracle”) which is a single currency GBP system.<br>• <strong>4.4</strong> Each month, OUCRU reports our local expenditure to Oxford, (albeit in GBP) to enable combined reporting to Grantors from the Oracle finance system.<br>• <strong>4.5</strong> To enable Researcher/PI and OUCRU Committee reporting our local finance system is configured to enable combined (Oxford and Local) expenditure in one report in the currency of the award.<br>• <strong>4.6</strong> Oxford will fund OUCRU in Advance in the currency of the grant that OUCRU receives. USD, GBP or EUROs.<br>Note: If OUCRU receives funding in a currency other than USD, GBP or EUROs, we can discuss with Oxford for a ‘pass through’ grant in another currency. However it is likely that this would only be provided if Oxford received significant funding in that currency and they would have minimal forex risk. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>5. Oxford University’s Foreign Currency Policy for Research Grants</strong><br>• Oxford’s foreign currency policy was developed for UK based researchers who receive funding in USD and other currencies with expenditure largely in GBP. Essentially Oxford Finance Central manage forex gains and losses and Researchers get a fixed GBP budget for the life of the Grant. Thus if a researcher has a USD award it gets translated at a fixed rate (X5) for the life of the project thus giving the Researcher the certainty of a GBP budget.<br>• However as the OUCRU Programme have USD grant funding with the expenditure largely in USD correlated spend, Oxford Central Finance have allowed a ‘flow through’ such that any USD and EURO grants flow through and OUCRU manages and budgets for these grants in USD and EURO respectively.<br>• The impact of the above is there is a conflict between correct reporting for PI’s and Grantors versus correct reporting for Oxford statutory reporting. Oxford have agreed to the methodology that allows for correct PI and Grantor reporting but requests that we minimise and report transactions that create material incorrect statutory reporting.<br>Note: Refer to Annex C for Oxford foreign currency policy for research grants. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>6. Principles which guide this policy</strong><br>• <strong>6.1 Key principles:</strong><br>  – Enable timely and accurate reports to OUCRU Directors, Programme Executive and other Committees, Researchers, Local Partners & Collaborators, Grantors and any other key stakeholders for decision making.<br>  – Ensure Grantor reporting meets their expectations – thus we shall minimise the number of currency conversions between currency of invoice or expenditure and the currency of the grant.<br>  Note: This ensures grantors auditors do not raise issues around forex gains and losses via multiple currencies.<br>  – Enable reconciliation of advances to/ from OUCRU, Oxford and other funders as applicable.<br>  – Allow Oxford to review and have oversight of the Advances reconciliation but not perform it.<br>  – Enable local regulatory reporting requirements – where any local regulations are at odds with this policy, local regulations take priority.<br>  – Provide a transparent audit trail from expenditure documentation and payment to funders reports/advances.<br>  – Expenditure in our finance systems to be accounted and reported in alignment with International Best Practice.<br>  – The finance system will enable the reporting of every transaction in the following classifications: Funder/Grantor – per award letter; Oxford – per application and OUCRU (international best practice which will enable financial management information to inform decision making and budget allocation).<br>• <strong>6.2 Secondary principles:</strong><br>  – Enable efficiency and accuracy by minimising manual calculations and adjustments at OUCRU and Oxford NDM.<br>  – Consistent processes such that for OUCRU Units and Oxford there are minimal differences between accounting for Oxford versus non Oxford funding. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>7. Risks</strong><br>• <strong>7.1</strong> It is entirely reasonable and imperative as good financial practice that Oxford and the OUCRU Programme are able to account for cash advances and provide Grantor reports accurately and timely.<br>• <strong>7.2</strong> If we cannot, then there is a risk that our main Grantor Wellcome, or any other funder, could infer there is a weak control environment and could withhold or withdraw its funding. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>8. Currency of grant applications</strong><br>• <strong>8.1</strong> OUCRU, where allowable by Grantors, shall apply for grants in the currency that best enables the research. This is usually in the currency that is most highly correlated to the majority of spend i.e. USD in Vietnam or Indonesia or GBP if the spend is mainly in the UK.<br>• <strong>8.2</strong> Where costs to be included in the application are initially budgeted for in a currency other than the currency of the application, then the foreign currency rate used to convert to the currency of the application shall be:<br>  – From a reputable source;<br>  – Use either the prior month end rate or up to a 12 month average;<br>  – Be acceptable to grantors;<br>  – The rate, source and date shall be documented.<br>Note: Reputable source can be Oxford University Treasury, a global currency website such as XE or a bank with an investment grade rating.<br>Note: It is generally best practice to use the latest forex rate available, other than for currencies which have unusual fluctuations.<br>Note: OUCRU Grants team are responsible for the forex rate for non-core grants and OUCRU Finance for core grants.<br>• <strong>8.3</strong> Where there is an application for USD funding, that will be administered by Oxford, and there is significant GBP spend, then OUCRU shall engage with NDM Finance and consider if a) the GBP spend should be budgeted in GBP and b) if so, what X5 rate should be used.<br>• <strong>8.4</strong> During the life of a USD grant, if it becomes known that there will be significant GBP spend not already identified, then OUCRU Finance and NDM Finance shall be consulted prior to incurring the expenditure.<br>Note: ‘Significant’ means greater than $30,000 but this number may be revised as GBP spend on USD grants is monitored and reported to Oxford.<br>• <strong>8.5</strong> If an OUCRU application has a significant foreign exchange risk and value then the application shall be reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and Programme Executive Committee and approved by the Director and Director of Operations prior to submission.<br>Note: Significant value is greater than USD 1 million.<br>• <strong>8.6</strong> Any forex risk is the researchers risk in the first instance.<br>Note: We minimise risk to the researchers by encouraging grants to be applied for in USD where allowable by the funder. In particular Wellcome generally funded in the currency that best enables the research. Thus we have both GBP and USD Wellcome core awards. USD is the currency best correlated to expenditure in Vietnam and Indonesia. Wellcome will make a split award if required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>9. Sub-contracting to Collaborators / Partners</strong><br>• <strong>9.1</strong> All funding from OUCRU to collaborators and partners shall be via a Legal Agreement.<br>• <strong>9.2</strong> Currently OUCRU do not make sub grants to partners / collaborators. Should this be required in the future, consultation and approval from the CFO and Director of Operations is required.<br>• <strong>9.3</strong> All Agreements shall be in the currency of the grant, unless any of the following exemptions apply;<br>  – Local regulations require contracts in VND, IDR or NPR; or<br>  – The Grantor has agreed to fund any foreign exchange loss, in which case we shall agree Agreement budgets in the currency that best enables the research; or<br>  – The lead researcher considers there is a case for the Agreement to be in a different currency, and if the risk can be managed within the grant, then approval from the CFO is required;<br>  – If the risk cannot be managed within the grant or the researcher other funding sources, then the proposal will be reviewed and approved by the Programme Executive Committee.<br>• <strong>9.4</strong> The physical transfer of advances should be made in the currency of the grant where possible. If there is a case for making the advance is a different currency, this will require the approval of CFO for OUCRU HCMC and respective Heads of Finance for OUCRU HN, ID and NP. Refer to Petty Cash below for additional exceptions.<br>Note: Factors to be taken into account include practical restrictions on transfer of funds to some countries; exchange rates available; number of conversions; Partner bank account, financial regulations.<br>• <strong>9.5</strong> When making an application, assumptions about exchange rates shall be set out clearly on budget schedules. These assumptions together with how any potential gains / losses will be accounted with or other risks resulting from currency fluctuations managed shall be set out clearly.<br>• <strong>9.6</strong> Any existing sub contracts with partners/collaborators that do not adhere to the above shall be considered as an exception and will not be restated. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>10. Petty cash</strong><br>• <strong>10.1</strong> There is a growing aim of funders and governments to reduce the use of cash and move to electronic payments. Therefore OUCRU will also move to cashless payments unless there is a business requirement or rationale.<br>Note: in OUCRU HCMC all cash advances are to be approved by the CFO, in other Units by the Head of Finance / Directors as required.<br>• <strong>10.2</strong> Petty cash shall only be provided to staff in one of the following currencies: USD; GBP; Euros; Local currencies for each Unit.<br>Note: This means that if a person is travelling to the UK and requires a travel advance, this will be in GBP, irrespective of the currency of the grant.<br>Note: currently OUCRU ID currently only has a GBP, Euro and IDR bank account and hence at present will advance in these currencies.<br>• <strong>10.3</strong> Petty cash may be made to both Staff and a Collaborator. A Collaborator is an employee of another organisation where OUCRU has a Project Agreement, MOU or Service Contract.<br>Note: limit of 2 million VND for VN for petty cash with exceptions for research projects.<br>• <strong>10.4</strong> Staff and Collaborators will be required to return any unspent currency in the currency of the advance and will be reimbursed any adverse forex gains/losses if sufficient documentation is provided.<br>Note: supporting documentation can be receipt, exchange slip, bank slip from money changer or bank.<br>• <strong>10.5</strong> If there is a requirement for advances in any currency other than the above, approval from the CFO for OUCRU HCMC and the respective Heads of Finance for OUCRU ID, HN and NP is required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>11. Supplier Advances</strong><br>• In line with Oxford Central policy, for Oxford grants, any Advances to suppliers will be expensed in the monthly expenditure reports. This means that Researcher and other reporting will include advances to suppliers as expenditure when paid and not when the good or services is delivered.<br>• Exceptions to this clause may be changed with the approval of the CFO.<br>Note: As this is not in line with international accounting practice, this will be an exception for reporting via Oxford only. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>12. Advances from Oxford (“Funding currency”)</strong><br>• Oxford will provide advances to OUCRU in the currency of the grant for GBP, USD and EURO. For grants in other currencies, Oxford convert the grant to GBP, using the X5 rate which remains the same for the entire length of the grant. The advance funding will be provided in GBP. Oxford then manage the forex risk between GBP and the grant currency.<br>• Each Unit’s Head of Finance will convert the funding currency (i.e. USD, GBP and EUROs) into their local currency bank account for payments in local currency. This is known as the pooled method. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>13. Which Bank Account to use?</strong><br>• Payments will be made from the bank account of the invoice or payment currency unless one of the exceptions below.<br>• Exceptions are:<br>  a) <strong>Advances</strong> – staff advances, especially travel advances, shall be provided in the most convenient currency for the person using it and local regulations should be adhered to.<br>  b) <strong>Petty cash</strong> – petty cash shall be provided in the most convenient currency , within the four currencies stipulated above, for the person using it and local regulations should be adhered to.<br>  c) <strong>The invoice or expenditure is in a currency that is not one of the bank accounts.</strong> In this case, the payment will be made from the bank account that minimises the number of foreign currency transitions. This should be the bank account equal to the grant currency.<br>  d) <strong>Other situations as approved by the CFO.</strong><br>Note: to be implemented when the D365 is implemented and we move to invoice basis for reporting. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>14. Roles and Responsibilities</strong><br>• The Programme Executive Committee shall approve any changes to this Policy.<br>• Researchers / Grant Applicants are responsible for adhering to this policy or seeking an exemption where there is an adverse impact on the research or if there are significant inefficiencies caused by this Policy.<br>• The CFO will approve any one off exceptions to this policy.<br>• The CFO/Programme Finance Committee will approve any changes to the Annexes and associated Procedures that implement this Policy.<br>• The following roles are responsible for ensuring this Policy meets their Units needs and ensuring their own processes and procedures enable this policy, are kept up to date, adhered to by their staff with any changes reviewed and approved by the CFO:<br>  – Head of Finance OUCRU – HCM<br>  – Head of Finance OUCRU - Hanoi<br>  – Head of Finance OUCRU - Indonesia<br>  – Head of Finance OUCRU - Nepal<br>  – Head of Financial Reporting and Planning OUCRU<br>  – CFO.<br>• If you are in doubt about how to comply with this policy, contact your Head of Finance or CFO as specified. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy"> <strong>15.

Notes and Annexes may be updated from time to time, as approved by the CFO.<br><strong>Expanded purpose and scope of use (guidance & examples):</strong><br>• This Policy clarifies how currency conversions, accounting treatments, advances and reconciliations are to be handled to ensure consistency across OUCRU Units and between OUCRU and Oxford University systems. It provides binding operational steps to be followed by finance teams, project managers and PIs.<br>• Example: when a USD grant funds in-country USD salary and local currency procurement, this Policy standardizes whether and how those USD receipts are held, converted and reported, and how resultant forex gains/losses are identified and recorded.<br>• Practical objective: minimise unnecessary currency conversions, preserve accurate grant balances in the grant currency, protect the transparency of advance usage, and provide a single source of truth for audits and grantor inspections.<br>• Outcomes expected: consistent month-end processes across Units, auditable reconciliations of advances within 30 days of month-end, and documented exception handling. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>2. Who this policy applies to?</strong><br>• <strong>2.1</strong> This policy is applicable to the OUCRU Programme. For the purposes of this Policy this includes the following Units: OUCRU HN, OUCRU HCM, OUCRU ID and OUCRU NP. These will be collectively referred to as “OUCRU”.<br>• <strong>2.2</strong> This policy applies to all employees and other individuals engaged on a temporary basis, who are involved in incurring expenditure or liabilities, making and receiving grants that form any part of the reporting of OUCRU to Grantors and Oxford.<br>• <strong>2.3</strong> For the avoidance of doubt this applies to all activities and grants which are administered via OUCRU.<br><strong>Expanded detail on applicability and exceptions:</strong><br>• Applies equally to Project Administrators, Finance Officers, Heads of Unit, Principal Investigators, Procurement staff, and those undertaking fieldwork with delegated financial authority.<br>• Temporary staff & consultants: any person issued an OUCRU advance, petty cash, or authorized to make payments on behalf of OUCRU must comply with this Policy, including submission of receipts and reconciliation within defined timescales.<br>• Exceptions: statutory or local regulatory rules that legally prevent compliance with any provision must be treated as exceptions; such exceptions require prior written approval from the relevant Head of Finance and the CFO, and must be logged in the Annexes Exception Log.<br>• Cross-border projects administered outside OUCRU but funded by OUCRU grants: this Policy applies to the financial flows from OUCRU to those projects. Where legal entities outside OUCRU receive funds directly from Oxford, those entities must follow local rules while OUCRU ensures reporting consistency. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>3. Background</strong><br>• <strong>3.1</strong> OUCRU receives funding from both Grants administered by Oxford and also directly. The former is the majority of funding of which the most significant are the Wellcome core awards. Funding is mainly in USD, with GBP the second biggest currency and some is in Euro, VND, IDR, Australian Dollar and other currencies.<br>Note: Currently OUCRU NP do not receive any NPR grants but may do in the future.<br>• <strong>3.2</strong> This is complex given the number of countries and systems involved and this Policy aims to set out the principles and rules for managing this complexity.<br><strong>Expanded background — context and examples of complexity:</strong><br>• Multiple funding sources: core grants, project grants, capacity-building awards, contracts and commercial income. Each source may have different currency, payment schedule and reporting rules. Example: a consortium award may be paid in euros to Oxford but require payments to Vietnamese partners in VND and externally contracted laboratories in SGD.<br>• Systems interaction: OUCRU local D365 holds multicurrency transactional detail while Oxford Oracle is GBP-based and used for statutory consolidation. Reconciling advances across these systems is a recurring complexity addressed by AROX and X5 mechanics (see Annex B).<br>• Operational risk example: a PI budgets travel in GBP for a UK visit but receives USD funding; failing to convert or approve in advance may expose the project to avoidable forex variation and procurement delays. This Policy standardizes advance currency decisions and escalation routes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>4. For grants administered by Oxford</strong><br>• <strong>4.1</strong> OUCRU expenditure is both locally incurred and by Oxford University (“Oxford”).<br>• <strong>4.2</strong> OUCRU incurred expenditure is accounted and reported using our local multicurrency finance system (“D365”).<br>Note: the current finance system, DAX, is being replaced with a new system (D365) for a go live in early 2023. All Units will then use this system.<br>• <strong>4.3</strong> Expenditure incurred directly by Oxford is accounted and reported using the Oxford finance system (“Oracle”) which is a single currency GBP system.<br>• <strong>4.4</strong> Each month, OUCRU reports our local expenditure to Oxford, (albeit in GBP) to enable combined reporting to Grantors from the Oracle finance system.<br>• <strong>4.5</strong> To enable Researcher/PI and OUCRU Committee reporting our local finance system is configured to enable combined (Oxford and Local) expenditure in one report in the currency of the award.<br>• <strong>4.6</strong> Oxford will fund OUCRU in Advance in the currency of the grant that OUCRU receives. USD, GBP or EUROs.<br>Note: If OUCRU receives funding in a currency other than USD, GBP or EUROs, we can discuss with Oxford for a ‘pass through’ grant in another currency. However it is likely that this would only be provided if Oxford received significant funding in that currency and they would have minimal forex risk.<br><strong>Expanded operational notes and step-by-step process:</strong><br>• Monthly reporting workflow (example): (1) Local finance posts all transactions in D365 using transaction date and local spot rate; (2) At month end, the Unit produces grant-level reports in grant currency; (3) Apply Monthly Rate translations for consolidated reporting; (4) Prepare Advance Reconciliation schedule showing advances received (AROX/X5 as applicable), advances spent, and balance to clear; (5) Submit consolidated pack to NDM/Oxford Research Accounting by the 7th working day of next month.<br>• Example journal mapping (D365 → Oracle): Local expenses recorded in D365 in local currency are translated to grant currency using Monthly Rate; D365 export includes ledger codes that map to Oracle project codes; Oracle receives GBP equivalent via predefined interface translating grant currency using X5 where required.<br>• Practical example: USD grant advance of $50,000 received by OUCRU HCMC. HCMC deposits USD into USD bank account; USD salaries paid in USD and local procurement paid by converting USD to VND. Unit records actual bank spot conversion rates in D365 and reconciles against AROX/X5 when reporting to Oxford. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>5. Oxford University’s Foreign Currency Policy for Research Grants</strong><br>• Oxford’s foreign currency policy was developed for UK based researchers who receive funding in USD and other currencies with expenditure largely in GBP. Essentially Oxford Finance Central manage forex gains and losses and Researchers get a fixed GBP budget for the life of the Grant. Thus if a researcher has a USD award it gets translated at a fixed rate (X5) for the life of the project thus giving the Researcher the certainty of a GBP budget.<br>• However as the OUCRU Programme have USD grant funding with the expenditure largely in USD correlated spend, Oxford Central Finance have allowed a ‘flow through’ such that any USD and EURO grants flow through and OUCRU manages and budgets for these grants in USD and EURO respectively.<br>• The impact of the above is there is a conflict between correct reporting for PI’s and Grantors versus correct reporting for Oxford statutory reporting. Oxford have agreed to the methodology that allows for correct PI and Grantor reporting but requests that we minimise and report transactions that create material incorrect statutory reporting.<br>Note: Refer to Annex C for Oxford foreign currency policy for research grants.<br><strong>Expanded clarifications and examples:</strong><br>• X5 mechanism illustrated: A $100,000 USD award when X5 = 0.80 results in an Oracle GBP budget of £80,000 for the life of the grant. If during the project the GBP/USD spot moves, Oxford central finance manages the net FX exposure centrally; PI retains the fixed GBP budget but OUCRU must ensure grant-level reports in USD match funder expectations.<br>• Flow-through scenario example: OUCRU receives USD funds for laboratory reagents purchased in USD. OUCRU manages these funds in USD bank accounts and reports expenditure to PIs and Grantors in USD, while translating to GBP for Oracle reporting using AROX/X5 rules. This preserves grantor reporting fidelity without exposing Oxford statutory accounts to unmanaged FX volatility.<br>• Conflict management: any transaction generating material statutory differences (e.g., repeated multi-currency conversions that create large net FX differences in Oracle) must be documented, justified, and reported in the monthly exception report to NDM and CFO. Materiality threshold is defined in Annexes (default: 1% of grant budget or USD 50,000; adjustable by CFO). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>6. Principles which guide this policy</strong><br>• <strong>6.1 Key principles:</strong><br>  – Enable timely and accurate reports to OUCRU Directors, Programme Executive and other Committees, Researchers, Local Partners & Collaborators, Grantors and any other key stakeholders for decision making.<br>  – Ensure Grantor reporting meets their expectations – thus we shall minimise the number of currency conversions between currency of invoice or expenditure and the currency of the grant.<br>  Note: This ensures grantors auditors do not raise issues around forex gains and losses via multiple currencies.<br>  – Enable reconciliation of advances to/ from OUCRU, Oxford and other funders as applicable.<br>  – Allow Oxford to review and have oversight of the Advances reconciliation but not perform it.<br>  – Enable local regulatory reporting requirements – where any local regulations are at odds with this policy, local regulations take priority.<br>  – Provide a transparent audit trail from expenditure documentation and payment to funders reports/advances.<br>  – Expenditure in our finance systems to be accounted and reported in alignment with International Best Practice.<br>  – The finance system will enable the reporting of every transaction in the following classifications: Funder/Grantor – per award letter; Oxford – per application and OUCRU (international best practice which will enable financial management information to inform decision making and budget allocation).<br>• <strong>6.2 Secondary principles:</strong><br>  – Enable efficiency and accuracy by minimising manual calculations and adjustments at OUCRU and Oxford NDM.<br>  – Consistent processes such that for OUCRU Units and Oxford there are minimal differences between accounting for Oxford versus non Oxford funding.<br><strong>Expanded principle application and checklist:</strong><br>• Principle checklist for month-end:<br>  1. Verify bank reconciliations for all currency accounts completed and signed off.<br>  2. Confirm Monthly Rate applied to all outstanding invoices and posted consistently.<br>  3. Confirm AROX/X5 applied correctly to advance clearings and Oracle mapping reconciled.<br>  4. Confirm any exceptions logged and approved by CFO.<br>• Decision rules (examples): If invoice currency = grant currency → pay from bank account in that currency where available. If no bank account in invoice currency and cost < local petty cash threshold → pay in local currency and document conversion. If cost > $10,000 and no bank account → escalate to Head of Finance for approval of bank choice and forex approach. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>7. Risks</strong><br>• <strong>7.1</strong> It is entirely reasonable and imperative as good financial practice that Oxford and the OUCRU Programme are able to account for cash advances and provide Grantor reports accurately and timely.<br>• <strong>7.2</strong> If we cannot, then there is a risk that our main Grantor Wellcome, or any other funder, could infer there is a weak control environment and could withhold or withdraw its funding.<br><strong>Expanded risk assessment, mitigation and sample risk register entries:</strong><br>• Key risks and mitigations:<br>  – Risk: Unreconciled advances creating restatement risk in Oracle. Mitigation: Monthly advance reconciliation with AROX/X5 evidence and independent review by Head of Financial Reporting.<br>  – Risk: Excessive currency conversions causing material forex variances. Mitigation: Use grant currency for contracts and advances where feasible; require CFO approval for exceptions; maintain log of conversions and reasons.<br>  – Risk: Local regulatory changes preventing transfers. Mitigation: Maintain local legal/treasury contact list and pre-approved contingency bank accounts; update Annexes when change occurs.<br>• Sample risk register entry:<br>  – ID: R-003<br>  – Risk: Supplier requires payment in non-pooled currency (e.g., SGD) but grant is in USD; conversion may create repeated forex adjustments.<br>  – Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium-High<br>  – Controls: Obtain written supplier quote in grant currency where possible; Head of Finance to approve payment account choice and record rationale; monitor and report monthly to CFO. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>8.

In particular Wellcome generally funded in the currency that best enables the research. Thus we have both GBP and USD Wellcome core awards. USD is the currency best correlated to expenditure in Vietnam and Indonesia. Wellcome will make a split award if required.<br><strong>Expanded guidance for budgeting and rate selection (worked examples):</strong><br>• Example 1: Budget created in VND but applying for USD grant. Steps: (1) Convert VND line items to USD using prior month end bank rate or a 12-month average if VND volatile; (2) Document the source and date of the rate on the budget cover sheet; (3) Include contingency for forex differences (recommended 2–5% depending on risk); (4) If grantor requires fixed exchange rate, note this in budget and seek CFO sign-off.<br>• Example 2: Application with mixed currency costs (staff in USD, equipment in GBP). Solution: Present budgets split by cost type and include a reconciliation schedule showing the currency conversion methodology and the overall budget in application currency; append sensitivity analysis showing +/- 5% exchange rate impact on budget. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>9. Sub-contracting to Collaborators / Partners</strong><br>• <strong>9.1</strong> All funding from OUCRU to collaborators and partners shall be via a Legal Agreement.<br>• <strong>9.2</strong> Currently OUCRU do not make sub grants to partners / collaborators.

If there is a case for making the advance is a different currency, this will require the approval of CFO for OUCRU HCMC and respective Heads of Finance for OUCRU HN, ID and NP. Refer to Petty Cash below for additional exceptions.<br>Note: Factors to be taken into account include practical restrictions on transfer of funds to some countries; exchange rates available; number of conversions; Partner bank account, financial regulations.<br>• <strong>9.5</strong> When making an application, assumptions about exchange rates shall be set out clearly on budget schedules. These assumptions together with how any potential gains / losses will be accounted with or other risks resulting from currency fluctuations managed shall be set out clearly.<br>• <strong>9.6</strong> Any existing sub contracts with partners/collaborators that do not adhere to the above shall be considered as an exception and will not be restated.<br><strong>Expanded contractual clauses and operational examples:</strong><br>• Recommended clause for agreements: “Payments to the Partner shall be made in [grant currency]. If local law requires payments in local currency, the Partner shall document bank confirmation of conversion rates applied and return any unspent amounts in the grant currency.”<br>• Example workflow for partner advance (USD grant, partner in Indonesia): (1) Legal Agreement signed specifying USD payments; (2) OUCRU makes USD advance to Partner’s USD bank account where possible; (3) Partner uses USD to pay suppliers in USD; (4) Partner returns unspent USD or exchanges and documents conversion rates; (5) OUCRU Head of Finance reviews partner reconciliation and supporting documentation before certifying expenditure.<br>• Exception approval template: requestor must submit Business Case, Estimated FX Exposure, Proposed Mitigation (e.g., partner hedging, bank confirmation), Approval signature fields for Head of Finance and CFO, and a required review date. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>10.

Therefore OUCRU will also move to cashless payments unless there is a business requirement or rationale.<br>Note: in OUCRU HCMC all cash advances are to be approved by the CFO, in other Units by the Head of Finance / Directors as required.<br>• <strong>10.2</strong> Petty cash shall only be provided to staff in one of the following currencies: USD; GBP; Euros; Local currencies for each Unit.<br>Note: This means that if a person is travelling to the UK and requires a travel advance, this will be in GBP, irrespective of the currency of the grant.<br>Note: currently OUCRU ID currently only has a GBP, Euro and IDR bank account and hence at present will advance in these currencies.<br>• <strong>10.3</strong> Petty cash may be made to both Staff and a Collaborator. A Collaborator is an employee of another organisation where OUCRU has a Project Agreement, MOU or Service Contract.<br>Note: limit of 2 million VND for VN for petty cash with exceptions for research projects.<br>• <strong>10.4</strong> Staff and Collaborators will be required to return any unspent currency in the currency of the advance and will be reimbursed any adverse forex gains/losses if sufficient documentation is provided.<br>Note: supporting documentation can be receipt, exchange slip, bank slip from money changer or bank.<br>• <strong>10.5</strong> If there is a requirement for advances in any currency other than the above, approval from the CFO for OUCRU HCMC and the respective Heads of Finance for OUCRU ID, HN and NP is required.<br><strong>Expanded petty cash controls, examples and templates:</strong><br>• Petty cash limit table (recommended):<br>  – Standard staff petty cash single advance: up to USD 200 (or local equivalent).<br>  – Travel advance (short trip): up to USD 1,000. Requires Travel Request Form signed by PI.<br>  – Research fieldwork exceptional petty cash: up to USD 2,000 with Head of Finance approval.<br>• Example petty cash transaction: Staff receives a travel advance of GBP 300 for UK travel. On return, staff submits travel receipts in GBP; if receipts total GBP 260, staff returns GBP 40 to finance in GBP. If staff paid for incidental local items in local currency and has receipts in IDR, finance converts receipts using Monthly Rate and reconciles to GBP advance. Any small forex differences under GBP 5 are absorbed by project; greater amounts are adjusted to project ledger and justification documented.<br>• Petty cash card options: Where possible use corporate prepaid cards to reduce cash handling.

Supplier Advances</strong><br>• In line with Oxford Central policy, for Oxford grants, any Advances to suppliers will be expensed in the monthly expenditure reports. This means that Researcher and other reporting will include advances to suppliers as expenditure when paid and not when the good or services is delivered.<br>• Exceptions to this clause may be changed with the approval of the CFO.<br>Note: As this is not in line with international accounting practice, this will be an exception for reporting via Oxford only.<br><strong>Expanded supplier advance policy and operational checklist:</strong><br>• Supplier advance request must include: Supplier name, reason for advance, contract reference, amount and currency, bank details, expected delivery date of goods/services, and evidence of supplier creditworthiness.<br>• Example accounting treatment (local practice preferred):<br>  – When advance paid: record Advance to Supplier (asset) in D365 in bank currency; if Oxford grant rule requires expensing on payment, also post an expenditure entry for Oracle reporting using AROX/X5 as required; reconcile asset to payment and clear on delivery with supplier invoice.<br>• Control steps: require two authorized signatories for supplier advances above USD 5,000; obtain procurement approval and copy of contract; hold supplier advance register with expected delivery milestone dates and evidence of follow-up. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>12. Advances from Oxford (“Funding currency”)</strong><br>• Oxford will provide advances to OUCRU in the currency of the grant for GBP, USD and EURO. For grants in other currencies, Oxford convert the grant to GBP, using the X5 rate which remains the same for the entire length of the grant. The advance funding will be provided in GBP. Oxford then manage the forex risk between GBP and the grant currency.<br>• Each Unit’s Head of Finance will convert the funding currency (i.e. USD, GBP and EUROs) into their local currency bank account for payments in local currency. This is known as the pooled method.<br><strong>Expanded pooled method and reconciliation guidance:</strong><br>• Pooled method detailed steps:<br>  1. Oxford issues advance in grant currency or in GBP (if X5 applies).<br>  2. OUCRU records the advance in D365 using AROX rate (as provided by Oxford) to link the advance to Oracle advance balance. Maintain advance register showing original currency, AROX, date and amount.<br>  3. When local currency payments are required, Head of Finance may convert part of advance using bank spot rate to local currency bank. Record conversion transaction and supporting bank evidence.<br>  4. At month end perform FIFO clearance: apply AROX to the portion of advance being cleared to match Oracle; post the clearing journal and update advance register.<br>• Example reconciliation: Oxford advance of €20,000. OUCRU converts €10,000 to VND at bank spot for local payment; D365 records €10,000 as spent and VND amount as local expense. At month-end OUCRU applies AROX to reconcile €10,000 to Oracle advance clearing and posts forex gain/loss on remaining advance if required. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>13. Which Bank Account to use?</strong><br>• Payments will be made from the bank account of the invoice or payment currency unless one of the exceptions below.<br>• Exceptions are:<br>  a) <strong>Advances</strong> – staff advances, especially travel advances, shall be provided in the most convenient currency for the person using it and local regulations should be adhered to.<br>  b) <strong>Petty cash</strong> – petty cash shall be provided in the most convenient currency , within the four currencies stipulated above, for the person using it and local regulations should be adhered to.<br>  c) <strong>The invoice or expenditure is in a currency that is not one of the bank accounts.</strong> In this case, the payment will be made from the bank account that minimises the number of foreign currency transitions. This should be the bank account equal to the grant currency.<br>  d) <strong>Other situations as approved by the CFO.</strong><br>Note: to be implemented when the D365 is implemented and we move to invoice basis for reporting.<br><strong>Expanded bank account decision matrix and examples:</strong><br>• Decision matrix (summary):<br>  – Invoice currency = bank account currency available → use that bank account. Reason: minimal conversions and transparent bank statement matching.<br>  – Invoice currency ≠ any bank account currency & invoice amount < petty cash threshold → local petty cash or card as convenient.<br>  – Invoice currency ≠ any bank account currency & invoice amount ≥ petty cash threshold → use bank account that minimises number of conversions (prefer grant currency bank where possible) and document rationale.<br>• Example: invoice in SGD for lab supplies, grant in USD, OUCRU holds USD and VND accounts but no SGD account. Choice: pay from USD account (single conversion UXD→SGD at bank spot) rather than VND->USD->SGD. Document bank spot rate and rationale, include in payment approval. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="OUCRU Foreign Currency Policy — Comprehensive"> <strong>14.
