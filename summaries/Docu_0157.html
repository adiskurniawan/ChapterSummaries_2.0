Either approach works, though the latter can better assist in maintaining an acceptable degree of corporate risk management, and is recommended.<br>The following list of corporate policies and explanatory comments covers a broad range of areas, including cash, hedges, barter transactions, inventory valuation, intangible assets, research and development costs, investments, debt extinguishment, warrants, lease terminations, dividends, options, and foreign currency translations. Though not all will apply to any company's specific circumstances, a number of them can be copied directly into one's corporate policy manual, depending on the structure of the company and its manner of doing business. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Accounts Payable</strong><br>• When paying from a copy of a supplier invoice, the additional approval of the controller must be obtained prior to payment. This policy reduces the risk of duplicate payment.<br>• There shall be a standard naming convention to create supplier names in the vendor master file. This policy reduces the incidence of multiple records for the same supplier.<br>• The billing and collection functions shall be segregated. This policy makes it more difficult for collections personnel to intercept incoming customer payments and alter the related invoices to hide the missing funds.<br>• All invoices must be issued within one day of shipment or completion of service delivery. This policy accelerates cash flow by avoiding billing delays.<br>• A single revenue recognition method shall be used for all installment sales. This policy prevents the manipulation of reported profitability levels by switching between the installment and cost recovery methods of revenue recognition.<br>• The company shall not use bill and hold transactions. This policy avoids use of a revenue recognition method that is easily subject to abuse.<br>• Access to the billing software shall be restricted to authorized users. This policy keeps unauthorized employees from issuing credit memos, which can hide the theft of incoming cash from customers. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Capital Stock</strong><br>• Stock issuance costs shall include only certificate printing, security registration, and legal and underwriting fees. This policy is designed to strictly limit the types of expenses that can be charged against the proceeds from a stock offering. By doing so, there is little room for extraneous expenses to be netted against a stock sale. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Cash Disbursements</strong><br>• No accounts payable personnel shall be authorized to sign checks or approve money transfers. This policy is designed to separate the preparation of accounts payable documents from their approval, thereby keeping a single person from falsely creating a payable and authorizing its payment to himself.<br>• All check or money transfers exceeding $<strong><em> shall be countersigned by the </strong></em> position. This policy provides for a second review of very large payments to ensure that they are appropriate, and to reduce the incidence of fraudulent transfers. Unfortunately, many banks do not review the existence of a second signature on a check, making this a less effective policy.<br>• All check signers shall be adequately bonded. This policy requires a company to retain an adequate level of bonding on its check signers to ensure that it will suffer no loss if a signer commits fraud. Bonding companies usually conduct a background review on check signers before agreeing to provide bond, which may give a company warning of previously unknown fraudulent employee activities, thereby allowing it to remove check-signing authority from someone before she has the opportunity to commit fraud again.<br>• The check signer will not sign blank checks under any circumstances. All checks signed must first have a payment date, payee, and payment amount listed on them in ink.<br>• The checking account will be funded only in an amount sufficient to match outstanding checks. This policy keeps a large fraudulent check from resulting in a large cash loss.<br>• All check stock shall include security features, such as watermarks and “Void” pantographs. This policy reduces the risk of check forgery.<br>• There shall be no more than two authorized check signers. One check signer shall be designated as the primary signer to whom all checks are routed, and the other is a backup who signs checks only when the primary check signer is not available. This policy reduces the risk that checks will be routed to the check signer least likely to question the payment.<br>• No check signers will have access to any accounting functions. This policy maintains check signer independence from the accounting function.<br>• Anyone conducting the bank reconciliation will have no access to other disbursement functions. This policy keeps the reconciliation person independent from the accounting function.<br>• Signature plates and signature stamps shall be stored in a locked safe at all times other than when check printing is being conducted. This policy reduces the risk of checks being fraudulently signed.<br>• A manual signature is required on all checks exceeding a dollar value of $<strong><em>. This policy allows for the use of signature plates for smaller checks, but imposes an additional review on larger payments.<br>• Electronic payments shall be the preferred method of payment. This policy reduces a variety of control problems associated with check payments.<br>• The company shall use “positive pay,” whereby it sends a list of issued checks to its bank, which the bank shall use as the basis for accepting checks. This policy eliminates the acceptance of fraudulent checks.<br>• All checks shall include printed security features, such as the use of a different font size and type for each printed character. This policy reduces the risk of check forgery.<br>• Password access shall be required for software used to initiate electronic payments. This policy reduces the risk of fraudulent transfers initiated from the software.<br>• A signed approval document is required for all manually initiated electronic payments as well as for the initial setup of supplier accounts for electronic payments. Electronic payments exceeding $</strong></em> require a second approval by the [position]. This policy increases the level of control over new suppliers, large payments, and any payments falling outside the normal purchasing system.<br>• All company bank accounts will have an automated clearinghouse (ACH) debit filter installed, with debits allowed only on an individual approval basis. This policy prevents unauthorized transfers of funds from the company's bank accounts.<br>• All suppliers who are allowed ACH debit access to a company bank account must have daily cumulative debit limits. This policy reduces the risk of large unauthorized ACH debits being made against company funds.<br>• All electronic payments shall be issued from a single account that is not automatically replenished. This policy reduces the risk of large fraudulent transfers of company funds. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Cash Receipts</strong><br>• The cash application staff must take the full amount of their earned vacation time each year. This policy improves the chances of detecting lapping schemes being run by cash application employees.<br>• The check handling and cash disbursement functions shall be segregated. This policy reduces the risk that employees will double-pay a supplier and then intercept a refund check from the supplier.<br>• Cash withdrawal privileges shall be assigned by the Board of Directors. This policy restricts access to deposited funds to authorized personnel.<br>• Checks shall be posted within one day of receipt. This policy accelerates the availability of cash and also ensures that problem checks are addressed as soon as possible.<br>• Access to the cash receipts software shall be restricted. This policy reduces the risk that cash receipt records will be altered in order to hide the theft of cash.<br>• Customers shall be periodically asked to remit electronic payments. This policy eliminates a number of control problems related to the receipt and processing of paper checks.<br>• Cash shall be deposited daily. This policy reduces the risk of on-site cash theft, while also accelerating the use of cash.<br>• The unapplied cash account shall be reviewed daily. This policy ensures that the unapplied cash account is reviewed constantly, so that unapplied cash problems are resolved as soon as possible.<br>• The company will offer a free <em>_</em> to each customer who is not offered a receipt at the point of sale. This policy allows customers to review the sale transaction to verify its accuracy.<br>• Each sales clerk is responsible for the contents of a specific cash register. This policy links specific employees to specific cash registers, so that missing cash can be more easily traced.<br>• Cash refunds must be authorized by a supervisor. This policy prevents sales clerks from recording a refund on their cash register and then pocketing the cash.<br>• All cash will be stored in the company safe during non-work hours. This policy improves the storage security of on-site cash.<br>• The corporate safe will be located in a visible position. This policy makes it more difficult for someone to break into the safe.<br>• The combination to the safe shall be changed at least once a year, or when anyone knowing the combination leaves the company. This policy makes it more difficult for someone to break into the safe.<br>• Surveillance systems shall monitor all cash registers. This policy deters fraud by sales clerks, who are aware of the monitoring. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Construction Contracts, Long-Term</strong><br>• Construction contract revenue shall be calculated using the percentage of completion method. This policy allows a company to calculate all construction revenues using a consistent methodology, so there is no question of using one method over another to gain a short-term advantage in reporting the amount of revenue.<br>• Accounts used in overhead pools shall be reviewed annually and altered only with management approval. This policy keeps the accounting staff from arbitrarily altering the contents of overhead cost pools. Overhead pool alterations are a classic approach for shifting expenses out of the current period and into construction-in-progress asset accounts. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Credit Card Receipts</strong><br>• All customer credit card information shall be shredded once payment transactions have been completed. This policy reduces the risk of customer credit information being fraudulently used.<br>• All employees having access to customer credit card information shall be bonded. This policy mitigates the risk that the company will suffer losses due to the theft of credit card information by its employees.<br>• A background check shall be conducted on all employees having access to customer credit card information. This policy increases the chance that unqualified employees will be kept away from customer credit card information.<br>• Access to computer files containing customer credit card information shall be strictly limited to authorized personnel. This policy reduces the risk that credit card information can be fraudulently accessed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Credit Management</strong><br>• The credit manager will create and enforce the use of a credit policy that defines how to calculate a credit limit, information required of customers in order to determine a credit limit, standard terms of sale, and collection techniques to be employed. This policy introduces consistency into the credit management process.<br>• Customers must complete a new credit application once every <strong><em> years if their annualized order quantity exceeds $</strong></em>. This policy allows the company to spot changes in the financial condition of its customers and adjust its credit limits accordingly.<br>• The credit manager will conduct periodic training of the credit staff in credit procedures. This policy reduces the risk that high-risk customers will be granted credit.<br>• No shipments are allowed without prior approval by the credit department. This policy reduces the risk of default by customers on outstanding receivables.<br>• The credit department will review the credit of all customer orders for which the order amount exceeds $<strong><em>. This policy reduces the risk of default by customers on outstanding receivables.<br>• The credit manager must approve all increases in customer credit limits. This policy reduces the risk that employees will approve significant credit increases without prior review.<br>• The credit manager will store the credit approval stamp in a locked location when it is not in use. This policy reduces the risk that a sales order will be fraudulently approved.<br>• Any customer whose check payment is returned due to not sufficient funds (NSF) must complete a new credit application. This policy improves the credit staff's ability to spot reductions in the financial condition of its customers and adjust credit limits accordingly.<br>• Customers must complete a new credit application if their newest order exceeds $</strong></em> and they have not placed an order in at least <em>_</em> year(s). This policy detects changes in the financial condition of sporadic customers.<br>• The credit department will review the credit status of the top 20% of customers each year, as measured by sales volume. This policy detects changes in the financial condition of the company's largest customers.<br>• The credit department will review the credit status of any customers who skip payments. This policy increases the credit staff's ability to spot customers whose financial condition is deteriorating, and adjust their credit limits accordingly.<br>• The credit department will review the credit levels of customers who stop taking early payment discounts. This policy increases the credit staff's ability to spot customers whose financial condition is deteriorating, and adjust their credit limits accordingly.<br>• The credit manager shall arrange for electronic credit rating change notifications for all major customers. This policy provides rapid warning of changes in the financial condition of customers. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Credit Memos</strong><br>• The collections and credit memo recording functions shall be segregated. This policy prevents a collections person from fraudulently intercepting customer payments and offsetting the related invoices with credit memos.<br>• Credit memos require prior supervisory approval. This policy prevents employees from intercepting incoming customer payments and then issuing credit memos to cancel the related customer receivable. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Current Liabilities</strong><br>• There shall be no carryforward of sick time past the current year. A common problem is for employees to build up massive reserves of unearned sick time, for which they must be paid when they eventually leave the company. This policy is designed to eliminate all unused sick time at the end of each calendar year, thereby keeping accrued sick time expense to a minimum.<br>• The number of hours of vacation time carried forward past the current year is capped at <em>_</em> hours. Some employees have a habit of not taking vacation time, resulting in large vacation accruals that can grow for years. Not only does this represent a significant current liability, but it also presents a control problem, since employees who do not take vacation may be staying on the job in order to hide fraudulent activities. This policy is designed to resolve both problems by allowing only a modest carryforward of earned vacation time.<br>• The vacation accrual shall be based on the maximum year-end carryforward amount of vacation hours. The accrual of vacation time is subject to a great deal of interpretation, since it can be based on the current amount of vacation time existing, the maximum available for the year, the maximum carryforward amount, or an estimate of the carryforward amount. By switching between various estimation methods, one can easily modify the vacation accrual to alter reported financial results. This policy requires one to use just one estimation method, thereby removing the variability from the calculation method. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Debt, Convertible</strong><br>• Debt conversions to equity shall always be recorded using the book value method. This policy keeps the accounting staff from switching between the book value and market value methods, whereby they could use the market value method to recognize gains and the book value method to avoid losses.<br>• Debt conversion calculations shall always be verified by the audit staff. This policy is designed to ensure that any expenses associated with debt conversions to stock shall be correctly calculated. Either internal or external auditors can be used; the main point is to require independent verification of all journal entries related to debt conversions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Debt Extinguishment</strong><br>• Debt shall not be extinguished early if the primary aim is to report a gain or loss on the extinguishment. If a company buys back its bonds when the stated interest rate on the debt is lower than the current market interest rate, it will recognize a gain on the transaction, but must refinance the purchase with more expensive debt at current market rates. Thus, this policy is designed to keep company management from creating transactions that appear to increase profits when the underlying results worsen the company's financial situation.<br>• When interest rates allow, the company shall repurchase its debt with less expensive debt. Though it sounds obvious, this policy is designed to force management to make the correct decision to always use less expensive debt, even though this will result in the recognition of a loss when the older, more expensive debt is eliminated from the company records. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Debt Issued with Stock Warrants</strong><br>• Debt issuance calculations incorporating attached stock warrants shall always be verified by the audit staff. This policy ensures that a separate party comprised of either internal or external auditors reviews the allocation of value between issued bonds and warrants, since the allocation is critical to the amount of bond discount that must be subsequently amortized. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Dividends</strong><br>• The Board of Directors shall not time property dividend declarations in order to influence reported earning levels from gains or losses recognized on property to be distributed. A gain or loss on assets must be recognized on the date of a dividend declaration if there is a difference between the fair market and book values of the assets. This can give rise to deliberate timing of dividend declarations in order to recognize gains or losses in specific reporting periods. This policy points out to directors that such behavior is not acceptable.<br>• The Board of Directors shall not time scrip dividend declarations to influence reported levels of indebtedness. A scrip dividend is a note payable issued to shareholders in place of cash, and is generally a bad idea unless there is an immediate expectation of cash receipts to pay off the resulting notes. Further, a Board could time a scrip dividend declaration to immediately follow the issuance of year-end financial statements, so that readers of the statements will not be aware of the sudden increase in indebtedness until the next financial statements are released. This policy is designed to bring the potential reporting issue to the attention of the Board, though it still has the ability to override the policy. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</strong><br>• The Board of Directors shall not time dividend declarations in order to influence the recognition of a compensation expense for unallocated ESOP shares. When shares held in an ESOP have not yet been allocated to employees, a declared dividend on those shares is charged to compensation expense in the current period. Since this may represent a significant alteration in reported profit levels, there can be a temptation to time the dividend declaration in order to avoid reporting a profit reduction. This policy is designed to bring the potential reporting issue to the attention of the Board, though it still has the ability to override the policy.<br>• Periodic accruals of ESOP compensation costs shall be based on the fair market value of company stock at the end of the current reporting period. It is common practice for a company to allocate shares from its ESOP to plan participants only at the end of each year, at which point compensation expense is recognized for the fair market value of the allocated shares. The amount of this compensation expense should be estimated and partially accrued in each month of the year leading up to the actual allocation. A problem can arise in estimating what the fair market value of the stock will be at the end of the year, since this can result in significant variances in estimates from month to month, with wildly fluctuating compensation expense accruals based on these estimates. The best approach is to use this policy to create the accrual based on the assumption that the actual fair market value at the end of the current reporting period shall match the year-end fair market value, thereby removing valuation estimates from the calculation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Evaluated Receipts System</strong><br>• Purchase orders shall be required for the purchase of all items exceeding <em>_</em>. This policy requires suppliers to have a purchase order number prior to shipping goods to the company; this is needed to approve receipts as part of the evaluated receipts program.<br>• Suppliers must attach the company-issued purchase order number to all shipments to the company. This policy ensures that the proper identification number is attached to every supplier delivery.<br>• All supplier deliveries will be rejected at the receiving dock if they do not contain an authorizing purchase order number. This policy prevents the receipt of items that cannot be identified for payment through the evaluated receipts system.<br>• The evaluated receipts system will automatically reject supplier deliveries if the purchase order unit balance is less than the delivered quantity. This policy prevents the receipt of excessively large deliveries.<br>• The evaluated receipts system will automatically flag any packing slip units of measure that do not match the purchase order units of measure. This policy reduces the risk that incorrect quantities are received.<br>• Access to the purchase order system shall be restricted to approved users. This policy reduces the risk that purchase orders will be improperly issued. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Fixed Assets</strong><br>• Management must approve all asset additions through a formal review process. This policy requires the management team to follow a formal review process that requires both the use of cash flow analysis and a hierarchy of approvals depending on the size of the proposed expenditure.<br>• All assets with a purchase price exceeding $1,000 shall be recorded as fixed assets. This policy reduces the amount of paperwork associated with fixed asset tracking by shifting smaller assets into the expense category.<br>• The capitalization limit shall be reviewed annually. This policy requires the controller to verify that the existing capitalization limit represents a reasonable balance of minimized record keeping for fixed assets and not an excessive amount of charges to expense for lower-cost assets.<br>• Capital investment results shall be reviewed annually. This policy requires a company to compare the actual results of a capital investment to what was predicted in its capital investment proposal form. The intent is to highlight incorrect assumptions that may still be used for other capital investment proposals, which can then be corrected to ensure better ongoing capital investment decisions.<br>• Conduct an annual inventory of all fixed assets. This policy requires the accounting staff to compare the record of fixed assets to their actual locations, typically resulting in not only adjustments to their recorded locations, but also a determination of the need to dispose of selected assets.<br>• A detailed record shall be maintained of each fixed asset acquired. This policy forces one to centralize the record-keeping for each asset, making it much easier to identify, locate, cost, and determine the warranty provisions associated with each one.<br>• All asset valuations associated with dissimilar asset exchanges shall be reviewed by an outside appraiser. This policy prevents the accounting staff from intentionally creating gains or losses on asset exchange transactions by assuming incorrect asset fair values.<br>• Copies of property records shall be maintained in an off-site location. This policy reduces the risk of lost records by requiring a periodic shifting of record copies to a secure outside location.<br>• All asset transfers and disposals require management approval. This policy brings any asset movements to the attention of the accounting department, which can then record the revised asset locations in the accounting records. The policy also allows one to review the proposed prices to be obtained from the sale or disposal of assets.<br>• Periodically review all fixed assets for impairment. This policy ensures that the accounting staff will regularly compare the book value of all fixed assets to their fair value, and write down the book value to the fair value if this is the lower amount.<br>• Responsibility for the following fixed asset functions will be segregated: fixed asset acquisition; fixed asset transaction recording; custody of the fixed asset; fixed asset disposal; reconciliation of physical assets to accounting records.<br>• Access to the fixed asset master file shall be restricted to authorized personnel. This policy keeps baseline fixed asset information from being altered.<br>• Fixed assets that are lost or stolen must be replaced with funds from the responsible department. This policy is designed to firmly affix responsibility for each asset to a specific department manager. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Foreign Currency Financial Statements, Translation Of</strong><br>• Periodically review the status of highly inflationary economies where subsidiaries are located. This policy is designed to determine the date when a local economy either becomes highly inflationary or is no longer defined as such under accounting rules. This is of importance in determining what type of translation method to use. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Foreign Currency Transactions, Translation Of</strong><br>• Maintain or have access to a database of daily exchange rates for all currencies in which the company conducts transactions. This policy allows the accounting staff to have ready access to exchange rates for its translation and currency transaction activities. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Funds Investment</strong><br>• At least $<strong><em> shall be invested in overnight investments and in negotiable marketable obligations of major U.S. issuers. This policy forces the treasury staff to attain a minimum level of liquidity. The fixed dollar amount used in the policy should be regularly reviewed to match upcoming budgeted working capital requirements.<br>• No more than </strong></em>% of the total portfolio shall be invested in time deposits or other investments with a lack of liquidity. This policy is similar to the preceding one, except that it ignores a fixed liquidity requirement, focusing instead on a maximum proportion of the total portfolio that must be retained for short-term requirements. This policy tends to require less periodic updating.<br>• The average maturity of the investment portfolio shall be limited to <em>_</em> years. This policy is designed to keep a company from investing in excessively long maturities. The policy can be broken down into more specific maturity limitations for different types of investments, such as 5 years for any U.S. government obligations, 1 year for bank certificates of deposit, and 270 days for commercial paper.<br>• Investments in foreign commercial paper shall be limited to those unconditionally guaranteed by a prime U.S. issuer and fully hedged. This policy is designed to lower the risk of default on investments in securities issued by foreign entities.<br>• Investments in commercial paper shall be limited to those of companies having long-term senior debt ratings of Aa or better. This policy is designed to limit the risk of default on commercial paper investments by focusing investments on only the highest-grade commercial paper.<br>• Investments in bank certificates of deposit shall be limited to those banks with capital accounts exceeding $1 billion. This policy is designed to limit the risk of default on certificates of deposit, on the assumption that large capital accounts equate to minimal risk of bank failure.<br>• Investments shall be made only in investments backed by U.S. government debt obligations. This policy can be used in place of the preceding ones that specify allowable investments in nongovernment investments. This policy tends to be used by highly risk-averse companies who place less emphasis on the return generated from their investments.<br>• Securities physically held by the company shall be stored with an accredited third party. This policy improves the physical control over securities.<br>• If an employee is responsible for the physical security of securities held by the company, then this person cannot also be responsible for recording the securities in the accounting records. This policy prevents an employee from removing securities and then eliminating evidence of the securities from the accounting records. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Goods in Transit</strong><br>• Revenue shall be recognized on goods in transit based on the point when the company no longer has title to the goods. This policy ensures that there is a consistent cutoff of the point at which a company records revenue on shipments of finished goods to customers.<br>• Incoming inventory shall be recorded after it has been received and inspected. This policy ensures that the quantity and quality of incoming inventory has been verified prior to recording it in the inventory database, thereby avoiding later problems with having incorrect usable quantities on hand.<br>• Goods received on consignment shall be identified and stored separately from company-owned inventory. This policy keeps a company from artificially inflating its inventory by the amount of incoming consignment inventory, which would otherwise increase reported profits.<br>• Consignment inventory shipped to reseller locations shall be clearly identified as such in both the shipping log and the inventory tracking system. This policy keeps a company from inflating its sales through the recognition of shipments sent to resellers that are actually still owned by the company.<br>• The company will not be responsible for in-transit inventory from suppliers. This policy requires the use of standard shipping terms on purchase orders that clearly shift responsibility to suppliers or third-party delivery entities. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Hedges</strong><br>• The determination of hedge effectiveness shall always use the same method for similar types of hedges. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allows one to use different assessment techniques in determining whether a hedge is highly effective. However, changing methods, even when justified, allows the accounting staff room to alter effectiveness designations, which can yield variations in the level of reported earnings. Consequently, creating and consistently using a standard assessment method for each type of hedge eliminates the risk of assessment manipulation.<br>• A hedge shall be considered highly effective if the fair values of the hedging instrument and hedged item are at least <em>_</em>% offset. GAAP does not quantitatively specify what constitutes a highly effective hedge, so a company should create a policy defining the number. Different hedging ranges can be used for different types of hedges. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Intangible Assets</strong><br>• All transactions involving the recording of intangible assets must be approved by the external auditors in advance. Intangible assets are subject to a considerable degree of scrutiny by auditors. By gaining advance approval of these transactions, it is much less likely that there will be significant audit adjustments related to them after the end of the fiscal year.<br>• Periodically review all intangible assets for impairment. This policy ensures that the accounting staff will regularly compare the book value of all intangible assets to their fair value, and write down the book value to the fair value if this is the lower amount. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Inventory Accounting</strong><br>• A complete physical inventory count shall be conducted at the end of each reporting period. This policy ensures that an accurate record of the inventory is used as the basis for a cost-of-goods-sold calculation.<br>• The materials manager is responsible for inventory accuracy. This policy centralizes control over inventory accuracy, thereby increasing the odds of it being kept at a high level.<br>• Cycle counters shall continually review inventory accuracy and identify related problems. This policy is intended for perpetual inventory systems, and results in a much higher level of inventory accuracy and attention to the underlying problems that cause inventory errors.<br>• No access to the inventory is allowed by unauthorized personnel. This policy generally leads to the lockdown of the warehouse, yielding much greater control over the accurate recording of inventory issuance transactions.<br>• No inventory transaction shall occur without being immediately recorded in the perpetual inventory database. This policy keeps the inventory database accurate at all times, preventing errors from arising when employees adjust the database on the incorrect assumption that the current record is correct.<br>• Only designated personnel shall have access to the inventory database and item master file. This policy ensures not only that only trained employees adjust inventory records, but also that the responsibility for their accuracy can be traced to designated people.<br>• Employees receiving inventory from another location or department must affirm the quantity, identity, and unit of measure of the inventory being received. This policy reduces the risk that inventory will be misidentified or fraudulently removed at the transfer point.<br>• The company's warehouse locations shall not be publicized. This policy reduces the risk of inventory theft by people outside the company. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Inventory Tracking</strong><br>• The warehouse staff is not allowed to record inventory transactions in the perpetual inventory card file. This policy reduces the risk that the warehouse staff will remove items from stock and record a transaction to eliminate the inventory.<br>• Access to the perpetual inventory card file shall be restricted to the warehouse clerk. This policy reduces the risk that inventory records will be fraudulently modified.<br>• All inventory transactions shall be entered in the inventory database within <em>_</em> minutes of the transaction occurring. This policy reduces the risk that cycle counting errors will be caused by late transaction entries.<br>• Access to the inventory database shall be restricted to authorized personnel. This policy reduces the risk that the database can be manipulated to hide evidence of inventory theft.<br>• The warehouse staff is not allowed to record specialty inventory transactions in the inventory database. This policy reduces the risk that specialty transactions will be incorrectly entered in the database.<br>• Specific character lengths shall be required for bar code scanner data entry fields. This policy reduces the risk that entries for other fields will be entered into the wrong database fields.<br>• The warehouse staff will upload data from their portable scanners at every scheduled work break. This policy improves the speed with which the inventory database is updated. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Inventory Valuation</strong><br>• ABC classification. The warehouse manager shall review the ABC classification of all items in stock at least once a year, and rearrange inventory storage within the warehouse based upon this revised classification.<br>• Bill of materials. Only the engineering department shall make changes to the bill of materials database.<br>• Changes in product components shall be immediately reflected in the associated bills of materials. This policy ensures that the costs assigned to a product through a bill of materials accurately reflect the current product configuration as designed by the engineering staff.<br>• Changes in production processes shall be immediately reflected in labor routings. This policy ensures that the costs assigned to products through labor routings accurately reflect the actual production process, equipment usage, and production staffing.<br>• Delivery. The company shall deliver completed customer orders no later than two days following receipt of those orders.<br>• Drop shipping. The company shall endeavor to have suppliers drop ship items directly to customers whenever possible.<br>• Engineering changes. The engineering department shall implement an engineering change order only after the proposed change has been formally reviewed and approved by the cost accounting, production, and manufacturing departments.<br>• Formal inventory obsolescence reviews shall be conducted at least annually. This policy requires an inventory review team to periodically scan the inventory for obsolete items, which not only removes the cost of such items from stock, but also gives management a chance to profitably dispose of older inventory items before they become worthless.<br>• Hedge inventory. The company shall not invest in hedge inventories for such events as possible strikes or supplier disputes without prior approval by senior management.<br>• Lower of cost or market calculations shall be conducted at least annually. This policy ensures that excessively high inventory costs are stripped out of the inventory before they can become an excessively large proportion of it. This policy may be modified to require more frequent reviews, based on the variability of market rates for various inventory items.<br>• Management shall actively seek out, identify, and dispose of scrap as soon as possible. This policy requires the production team to remove scrap from the manufacturing process immediately, thereby keeping it from being recorded in the inventory records and artificially inflating profits.<br>• Obsolescence. Inventory parts shall be designated obsolete once the products of which they are components have been withdrawn from production and there is no recent evidence of service or repair requirements.<br>• Only designated personnel shall have access to the labor routing and bill of materials databases. This policy ensures that untrained employees are kept away from the critical computer files needed to value inventory quantities.<br>• Putaway. Inventory items shall be put away immediately after receipt.<br>• Standard cost records shall be updated at least annually. This policy ensures that standard costs used in inventory valuations do not stray too far from actual costs.<br>• Supplies reordering. Supplies not tracked through the inventory system shall be visually reviewed at least daily for reordering purposes.<br>• Impacted inventory will be drawn down prior to the implementation of engineering change orders, with the exception of change orders related to product safety. This policy reduces the risk of inventory obsolescence due to engineering change orders. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Investment, Equity Method of Accounting</strong><br>• The CFO shall regularly review with the Board of Directors the existing assumptions of significant influence over all entities the voting common stock of which the company owns between 20 and 50%. Evidence of significant influence requires a company to use the equity method in reporting the financial results of an investee, whereas a lack of influence would require it to record the investment in an investment portfolio category. Regularly reviewing the level of influence over an investee will ensure that the appropriate accounting treatment is used.<br>• The tax rate used to recognize taxes under equity method gains shall be the higher of the rates paid on dividend income or sale of the investment. The income tax rate used to record equity method transactions can be either the tax rate on dividends or from sale of the investment, depending on the investor's intent to eventually dispose of the method. Always using the higher tax rate goes against GAAP to some extent, but keeps the accounting staff from inflating income by using the more conservative tax rate. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Investment in Debt Securities Accounting</strong><br>• The unrecognized amount of gains or losses on held-to-maturity securities shall be regularly reported to the Board of Directors. Management may designate poor-performing debt securities as held-to-maturity, in which case any changes in their fair value will not be recognized. This policy is designed to reveal any gains or losses that would be recognized if these securities were to have any other portfolio designation, so the Board is aware of any “hanging” gains or losses.<br>• Debt securities shall not be classified as held-to-maturity unless sufficient investments are already on hand to cover all budgeted short-term cash requirements. GAAP already requires that debt securities not be classified as held-to-maturity if a company does not have the ability to hold the securities for the required time period—this policy is more specific in stating that all anticipated cash flows be fully covered by other investments before any debt securities receive the held-to-maturity classification. The policy makes it more likely that a company will not be forced to prematurely liquidate its held-to-maturity debt portfolio. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Investment Portfolios, Transfer Between</strong><br>• The Board of Directors shall be notified of the reasons for any significant shift in the designation of securities between the held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, and trading portfolios, and the approximate impact on different categories of income. This policy is designed to require management to justify its actions in shifting securities between portfolios, which is likely to reduce the amount of shifting, while also keeping the Board informed of any likely movements of gains or losses between the Operating Income and Other Comprehensive Income parts of the income statement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Investment Portfolios, Transfer of Debt Securities Among</strong><br>• The Board of Directors must authorize all shifts in investment designation out of the held-to-maturity portfolio. There are specific accounting instances where the transfer of securities out of the held-to-maturity portfolio will preclude a company's subsequent use of the held-to-maturity portfolio. Accordingly, the Board of Directors should be notified of the reasons for such a designation and give its formal approval before the designation change can be made. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Just-in-Time Manufacturing Systems</strong><br>• All suppliers needed for the just-in-time system shall have their product quality and delivery reliability certified by the company. This policy improves the company's ability to have incoming goods shipped directly to the production lines without any receiving inspection.<br>• No workstation operator shall process work without an authorization to create a specific quantity of inventory (e.g., a kanban). This policy reduces the risk that excessive quantities of inventory will be produced.<br>• Standard container sizes shall be used to move, store, and count inventory in the production process. This policy makes it easier to track inventory quantities. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Lease Terminations</strong><br>• Only the Board can approve lease termination agreements. GAAP requires that the expenses associated with lease terminations be recognized on the date when the lease termination notice is issued to the lessor. Since the expenses recognized can be substantial, there can be a tendency by management to time the termination notice to alter reported financial results. By requiring the Board to issue final approval of such agreements during its regularly scheduled meetings, management is less likely to intentionally alter financial results through the use of lease termination agreements. The policy is even more effective if the Board is informed of the amount of any lease expense to be recognized as part of the termination notification. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Lessee Accounting</strong><br>• Lease termination dates shall be regularly reviewed. It is extremely common for lease agreements to require a written notice of lease cancellation near the end of the lease term. If no written notice is received by the lessor, then the lease payments are contractually required to be continued for some predetermined number of months, which usually is detrimental to the lessee. This policy is designed to ensure a periodic review of lease termination dates, so that lease cancellation notices can be sent in a timely manner.<br>• No company leases shall include a guaranteed residual value clause. A company can negotiate smaller periodic lease payments by guaranteeing the lessor a significant residual value at the end of the lease, which typically calls for a large cash payment back to the lessor. Though such a clause can assist in reducing up-front cash payments, it can also result in an unacceptably high cash liability in the future.<br>• The legal department shall send a copy of each signed lease document to the accounting department. The accounting department must be aware of the amount and timing of all lease payments, so the legal department should be required to provide it this information via copies of all signed leases. For larger companies, this policy would require that leases be sent to the finance department instead of accounting, since the finance staff would be more concerned with cash forecasting. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Manufacturing Resources Planning System (MRP II)</strong><br>• A minimum level of inventory record accuracy of 95% shall be maintained. This policy supports the minimum inventory record accuracy level for an MRP II system.<br>• A minimum labor routing record accuracy of 95% shall be maintained. This policy supports the minimum labor routing record accuracy level needed for an MRP II system.<br>• A minimum level of bill of materials record accuracy of 98% shall be maintained. This policy supports the minimum bill of materials record accuracy level needed for an MRP II system.<br>• Changes in product components shall be immediately reflected in the associated bills of materials. This policy ensures that the costs assigned to a product through a bill of materials accurately reflect the current product configuration as designed by the engineering staff.<br>• Changes in production processes shall be immediately reflected in labor routings. This policy ensures that the costs assigned to products through labor routings accurately reflect the actual production process, equipment usage, and production staffing.<br>• Access to the inventory item master file shall be restricted to authorized personnel. This policy reduces the risk of MRP II logic errors caused by incorrect record changes.<br>• Purchased quantities shall be based on specific production requirements. This policy reduces the placement of large-quantity orders that have lower per-unit purchase costs. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Marketable Equity Securities Accounting</strong><br>• All securities purchases shall be designated as trading securities at the time of purchase. This policy is intended to avoid the designation of an investment as “available for sale,” which would allow management to avoid recording short-term changes in the fair value of the investment in reported earnings. The policy removes the ability of management to alter financial results by shifting the designation of an investment.<br>• All losses on securities designated as available-for-sale shall be considered permanent. Accounting rules allow one to avoid recognizing losses on available-for-sale securities by assuming that the losses are temporary. By using this policy to require an immediate write-down on all losses, management no longer has the ability to manipulate earnings by making assumptions that losses are temporary in nature.<br>• Available-for-sale securities shall not be sold solely to recognize related gains in their fair market value. Accounting rules do not allow ongoing recognition of gains in the value of available-for-sale securities in earnings until they have been sold, so there is a natural temptation to manage earnings by timing their sale. This policy is designed to set an ethical standard for management to prevent such actions from taking place. In reality, this is a difficult policy to enforce, since management can find reasonable excuses for selling securities when their unrecognized gains are needed for bookkeeping purposes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Notes and Bonds</strong><br>• All notes and bonds shall be issued only subsequent to approval by the Board of Directors. This policy gives the Board control over any new debt liabilities. In reality, anyone lending money to the company will require a Board motion, so this policy is likely to be imposed by the lender even if it does not exist internally.<br>• Debt sinking funds shall be fully funded on scheduled dates. This policy is designed to force the treasury staff to plan for the timely accumulation of funds needed to pay off scheduled principal payments on debt, thereby avoiding any last-minute funding crises.<br>• Recognition of unearned revenue for attached rights shall match offsetting discount amortization as closely as possible. This policy is designed to avoid the manipulation of revenue recognition for attached rights. For example, if a value is assigned to an attached right, the debit will be to a discount account that will be ratably recognized as interest expense over the term of the debt; however, the credit will be to an unearned revenue account for which the potential exists to recognize revenue much sooner, thereby creating a split in the timing of revenue and expense recognition. Though this split may be valid in some cases, an effort should be made to avoid any significant disparities, thereby avoiding any surges in profits.<br>• The fair market interest rate shall be used to value debt transactions where property is being obtained. This policy is designed to prevent any manipulation of the value assigned to an acquired asset as part of a debt-for-property transaction. By always using the fair market rate, there is no possibility of using an excessively high or low interest rate to artificially alter the cost at which the acquired property is recorded on the company books.<br>• Debt shall always be issued at stated rates as close to the market interest rate as possible. Though there are valid reasons for issuing debt at rates significantly different from the market rate, this causes a problem with determining the market rate to be applied to debt present value calculations, which has a significant impact on the amount of interest expense recognized. Instead, this policy avoids the problem by requiring debt issuances to have stated interest rates so close to the market rate that there is no possibility of a significant debt valuation issue. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Order Entry</strong><br>• Extended rights of return shall not be allowed. This policy limits the ability of the sales staff to engage in channel stuffing and sales declines in subsequent periods.<br>• Special sale discounts shall not be allowed without senior management approval. This policy prevents short-term sales bubbles that result in channel stuffing and sales declines in subsequent periods. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Payroll</strong><br>• Employees can carry a maximum of <em>_</em> hours of unused vacation time forward into the next calendar year. This policy greatly reduces the effort required to calculate the year-end vacation expense accrual, and also keeps employees from building up large unused vacation balances.<br>• The company does not make purchases on behalf of employees. This policy keeps the payroll staff from having to track a series of period deductions from employee pay in order to cover the cost of items purchased by the company for employees.<br>• The company does not issue advances on company pay. This policy keeps the payroll staff from having to manually enter pay deductions into the payroll system to offset pay advances.<br>• The company will provide access to computer kiosks for all employees. This policy assists the payroll department in requiring employees to switch to electronic pay stubs and W-2 forms, so the company no longer has to manually distribute these documents.<br>• All employees shall be paid by direct deposit or payroll card. This policy is useful for switching 100% of employees to electronic payments, either through a bank account (with direct deposit) or to a payroll debit card.<br>• Commissions shall be paid based only on cash received. This policy enhances the intensity of a company's collection efforts by indirectly involving the sales staff in collection efforts if they wish to be paid a commission.<br>• Final commissions for terminated sales staff shall be based on cash received from shipments made up until the termination date. This policy requires that actual cash receipts data be used as the basis for final commissions, thereby eliminating the risk of a commission overpayment that would otherwise not be recoverable.<br>• The chief financial officer (CFO) must approve all off-cycle payrolls. This policy tends to reduce the number of time-consuming additional payrolls, on the assumption that few employees will want to make this request of the CFO.<br>• Employees are responsible for removing ineligible family members from the company health plan. This policy allows the company to extract reimbursement from employees if it is discovered that they have incorrectly placed ineligible family members on their insurance applications.<br>• No employee can be responsible for both processing payroll and distributing pay. This policy ensures that proper segregation of duties keeps anyone from creating a paycheck, recording it, and then pocketing the funds.<br>• All pay advances require the written approval of the employee's immediate supervisor, department manager, and controller. This policy introduces a sufficient number of approvals to discourage the use of pay advances.<br>• All negative deductions must be approved by the payroll manager. This policy reduces the risk that employees will fraudulently receive additional pay through the use of negative deductions.<br>• Hourly employees must submit an approved timesheet by the designated date and time in order to be paid as part of the regular payroll cycle. This policy puts the burden of timesheet submission on individual employees, rather than the payroll staff.<br>• Absent employees must be given a signed authorization to another employee to obtain the employee's paycheck on their behalf. This policy reduces the company's liability in case another employee diverts funds from the employee's paycheck.<br>• The paymaster has no other payroll-related responsibilities than distributing paychecks. This policy reduces the risk that an employee will create paychecks for ghost employees and then retain the checks.<br>• Payroll taxes shall be remitted in full on a timely basis. This policy makes it clear to the payroll manager that taxes must be remitted in the full amount and on time, with no exceptions.<br>• Pay authorization documents shall be centrally stored. This policy ensures that access to all pay-related authorizations can be easily restricted, while also reducing the likelihood that authorization documents can be lost.<br>• Access to the payroll system and employee master file shall be restricted to authorized personnel. This policy reduces the risk of fraudulent payroll transactions.<br>• Access to the employee master file shall be segregated from other payroll activities. This policy makes it more difficult to both create and pay a ghost employee.<br>• Any change to an employee's direct deposit information requires the employee's signature and formal identification. This policy reduces the risk that payroll payments will be diverted to the wrong party.<br>• Employees accessing online payroll remittance and W-2 information must set up user identification and password information to access their accounts. This policy keeps unauthorized parties from accessing confidential payroll information. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Petty Cash</strong><br>• Reimbursements from petty cash are authorized for expenditures of up to $<em>_</em> per transaction. This policy keeps employees from obtaining large payments from petty cash funds that would otherwise have required supervisory approval prior to payment.<br>• Petty cash may not be used for advances, or the reimbursement of gifts, personal loans, traffic citations, personal expenses, or interest charges. This policy prevents petty cash payments for expenditures that would not normally be approved for payment.<br>• The petty cash fund shall be small enough to require replenishment about twice per month. This policy establishes a rough guideline for establishing the size of a fund.<br>• Petty cash should be kept in a locked box within a locked drawer when the custodian is absent. This policy recognizes the ease with which petty cash can be stolen, and so requires double locking of the storage location.<br>• A petty cash contact alarm shall be installed under every petty cash box. This policy results in an alarm when a petty cash box is physically removed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Procurement Cards</strong><br>• All procurement card users will follow a standard monthly reconciliation checklist to ensure that all card liabilities for which there are no receipts are reported, and that card liabilities are rejected if there are sufficient grounds for doing so. This policy reduces the risk that expenditures will be incorrectly charged or incurred.<br>• The managers of all departments to which procurement card expenses are charged must approve those expenses. This policy reduces the risk that expenses will be improperly incurred or incorrectly charged.<br>• Procurement card users shall not use their cards to acquire materials normally ordered through the MRP II system. This policy keeps purchases from occurring outside the automated purchasing system of the MRP II system.<br>• Cash advances shall be prohibited for all procurement cards, unless the cards are specifically intended for travel-related expenditures. This policy reduces the risk of fraudulent access to and use of cash.<br>• Department managers must approve all changes in procurement card spending limits, which shall be restricted to suppliers having a certain SIC code, daily purchasing limits, and monthly purchasing limits. This policy reduces the risk of overspending or fraudulent purchases.<br>• Procurement cards shall be restricted to the smallest possible number of authorized users. This policy prevents the proliferation of procurement cards to users who have less control over their spending habits.<br>• Procurement card users must sign an agreement with the company, detailing their responsibilities in using the card, and clearly stating the consequences of misuse. This policy acts as a deterrent to anyone who might otherwise be tempted to misuse a card. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Purchasing</strong><br>• A purchase order must be issued for all requisitions exceeding $<strong><em>. This ensures that all requisitions are first reviewed by the purchasing department for correct pricing, sourcing, quality, and payment terms prior to ordering.<br>• Employees authorized to create a record in the vendor master file shall be barred from approving payments to suppliers. This policy reduces the risk that an individual will create a fake supplier and then approve payments to it.<br>• Password access shall be required to make changes to the vendor master file. This policy reduces the risk that fraudulent or incorrect payments will be made.<br>• A tracking log shall record all changes made to the vendor master file. This policy reduces the risk that fraudulent or incorrect payments will be made.<br>• A person outside of the purchasing or payables departments shall regularly review all changes made to the vendor master file, which shall be traced with a tracking log. This policy reduces the risk that fraudulent or incorrect payments will be made.<br>• The vendor master file shall be purged of duplicate and noncurrent supplier records at least once a year. This policy reduces the risk of having multiple supplier accounts.<br>• Access to the purchase order system shall be restricted to approved users. This policy reduces the risk that purchase orders will be improperly issued.<br>• Requisition responsibility shall be assigned to one person for specific areas of the warehouse. This policy reduces the risk of duplicate requisitioning by different warehouse employees.<br>• The purchasing and receiving functions shall be segregated. This policy keeps employees from initiating orders and removing the received items from the company.<br>• The purchasing manager will regularly notify suppliers of the names of company employees who are allowed to issue purchase orders for specific commodity groups. This policy reduces the risk of fraudulent orders being placed.<br>• The purchasing manager will regularly notify suppliers that the company does not consider verbal purchase authorizations to be a purchasing commitment. This policy provides a deterrent to the issuance of verbal purchase orders by employees.<br>• The purchasing manager must countersign all purchase orders exceeding $</strong></em>. This policy provides additional oversight of large purchasing commitments.<br>• The warehouse manager will conduct a daily review of inventory, using a visual reordering system, to determine reordering needs, and communicate this information to the purchasing department. This policy reduces the risk of inventory stockouts.<br>• Minimum order quantities shall be used when cost-effective. This policy enforces the acquisition of goods in the smallest possible minimum order quantities, so there is less inventory on hand. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Receiving</strong><br>• All supplier deliveries will be rejected at the receiving dock unless there is an authorizing purchase order with a sufficient quantity open to cover the unit quantity of the delivery. This policy reduces the risk that unauthorized deliveries will be received.<br>• Incoming inventory shall be recorded after it has been inspected. This policy ensures that the quantity and quality of incoming inventory has been verified prior to recording it in the inventory database, thereby avoiding later problems with having incorrect usable quantities on hand.<br>• In cross-docking situations, the data entry of receiving documents shall be replaced by advance shipping notices. This policy automates the entry of receiving information. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Research and Development Costs</strong><br>• All research and development (RD) costs must be recorded under unique general ledger account codes. Because GAAP requires that all RD costs be charged to expense in the current period, it is imperative that these costs be segregated for easy review. Otherwise, it is likely that the costs will be mixed into other general ledger accounts and possibly capitalized, thereby incorrectly increasing reported profits. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Revenue, Barter</strong><br>• The company shall not engage in barter transactions whose sole purpose is the creation of revenue. This policy informs the accounting staff that it is unacceptable to create barter swap transactions whose sole purpose is to create additional revenue without the presence of any economic reason for the transaction.<br>• All expenses associated with barter transactions shall be recognized in the same proportions as related revenues. This policy is designed to keep expenses associated with barter swap transactions from being significantly delayed while revenues are recognized up front. The policy will keep profits from being incorrectly recorded in advance. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Revenue, General</strong><br>• Preliminary revenue summaries shall be issued no later than one day following the close of an accounting period. This policy is designed to prevent the accounting staff from artificially keeping the books open past the end of the reporting period, since it must commit to a specific revenue figure within a day of closing.<br>• Extended rights of return shall not be allowed. This policy limits the ability of the sales staff to engage in “channel stuffing,” since it cannot offer special rights of return to customers in exchange for early sales. The policy keeps a company from gyrating between large swings in sales caused by channel stuffing.<br>• Special sale discounts shall not be allowed without senior management approval. This policy prevents large bursts in sales caused by special price discounts that can stuff a company's distribution channels, causing rapid sales declines in subsequent periods.<br>• The company shall not use bill and hold transactions. Though bill and hold transactions are allowable under clearly defined and closely restricted circumstances, they are subject to abuse, and so should generally be avoided. This policy ensures that bill and hold transactions would require Board approval before being used.<br>• Estimated profits on service contracts shall be reviewed monthly. This policy ensures that estimated losses on service contracts are identified and recognized promptly, rather than being delayed until the contracts are closed. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Revenue Recognition When Collection Is Uncertain</strong><br>• A single revenue recognition method shall be used for all installment sales. This policy keeps an accounting department from switching back and forth between the installment method and cost recovery method for recognizing this type of revenue, which would otherwise allow it to manipulate reported levels of profitability. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists</strong><br>• A sales return allowance shall be maintained for all goods sold with a right of return. This policy ensures that profits are not initially overstated by the amount of any potential returns by requiring an initial reserve to be established. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Shipping</strong><br>• No order will be shipped unless its sales order has been approved by the credit department. This policy reduces the risk that unapproved orders will be inadvertently shipped.<br>• Consignment inventory shipped to reseller locations shall be clearly identified as such in both the shipping log and the inventory tracking system. This policy reduces the risk that off-site inventory will not be accounted for. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Stock Appreciation Rights</strong><br>• Vesting periods for stock appreciation rights (SAR) shall not exceed the standard vesting period used for other stock grants. Since the gradual increases in the value of a SAR grant must be charged to expense in the period when the increases occur, a company could delay this expense recognition by lengthening the service period required before the SAR is earned by an employee. This policy is designed to require the use of a standard vesting period for all types of stock grants, thereby avoiding extremely long SAR vesting periods. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Stock Options</strong><br>• The current dividend yield shall be used for all option valuation assumptions. When a company uses the popular Black-Scholes option pricing formula to determine the compensation expense associated with its options, it can reduce the amount of expense recorded by assuming an increased dividend yield in the future. This policy is designed to freeze the dividend assumption, thereby nullifying the risk of deliberate expense modifications in this area.<br>• The expected term of all options shall be based on the results of the last <em>_</em> years. When a company uses SFAS 123 guidelines to record compensation expense, part of the calculation is an estimate of the time period over which options are expected to be held by recipients. If this assumed period is shortened, the value of the options is reduced, resulting in a lower compensation expense. Consequently, there is a tendency to assume shorter expected terms. This policy is designed to force the accounting staff to always use a historical basis for the calculation of expected terms, so there is no way to modify the assumption.<br>• Option-based compensation expense shall be adjusted at regular intervals for the forfeiture of options. An estimate of option forfeitures should be made at the time when option compensation expenses are first made under SFAS 123. If actual experience with option forfeitures varies from expectations, the difference must be recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the current period. The trouble is that accountants can ignore the changes for some time and record them only in accounting periods where their impact is most useful to the accountant. This policy is designed to avoid the timing of adjustments by requiring regular adjustments at set intervals. Including this action item in the month-end closing procedure is a good way to ensure compliance with the policy.<br>• Option vesting periods shall be identical for all option and stock grants. When a company reduces the vesting period for its options, it can reasonably justify using a shorter option life if it expenses its stock options using the Black-Scholes model. This policy discourages the Board of Directors from shortening vesting periods by making it necessary to also shorten all types of stock grants at the same time, thereby also introducing some vesting consistency to the complete range of corporate stock grants.<br>• Compensation expenses shall be recognized for both new option grants and those still outstanding from prior years. When a company elects to charge its option grants to expense, a common practice is to ignore outstanding options issued in prior years, and instead charge only new options to expense. This underreports the prospective compensation expense. This policy is designed to force full disclosure of the expense associated with all option grants.<br>• The minimum value model shall be used to calculate compensation expense for option grants as long as the company is privately held. When a company is privately held, it can still use the fair value method promulgated under SFAS 123. The problem is that the fair value method requires the use of a stock volatility measure as part of the calculation, which is entirely a matter of opinion when shares are not publicly traded. To avoid the potential manipulation associated with volatility calculations under this scenario, the policy recommends the use of the minimum value model, which is the same as the fair value method, minus the stock volatility calculation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Stock Subscriptions</strong><br>• Stock subscription plans for employees must be approved by the Board of Directors. This policy requires the Board to authorize the number of shares that may be sold to employees, as well as any discounts on those purchases. By requiring ongoing approval of additions to the number of shares authorized for distribution, the Board can maintain effective control over this program. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Corporate Policies Manual"> <strong>Stock, Treasury</strong><br>• The initial sale price of all stock shall be recorded by stock certificate number. When stock is repurchased into the treasury, it is possible that the original sale price of each share repurchased must be backed out of the stock account, depending on the accounting method used. This policy requires that sufficient records be kept to allow such future treasury stock transactions to be properly recorded.<br>• The circumstances of any greenmail stock repurchases shall be fully documented. This policy is designed to provide proper documentation of the amount of any stock repurchased under the threat of a corporate takeover. By doing so, one can more easily determine the price under which shares were repurchased, as well as the market price of the stock on that date. This is critical information for the recognition of expenses related to excessively high repurchase costs, which can have a major negative impact on reported earnings levels. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 52</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table2" data-table="Docu_0157_02" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Table 2</strong></div>

otherwise allocation must wait until AP closed.<br>• Accurate perpetual inventory system and cycle counts reduce need for physical counts; without these, physical counts or more work after period-end required.<br>• Online bank access enables immediate bank reconciliations; absence means possible waiting for mailed statements and either delayed close or risk of issuing results before bank activity known.<br>• Receiving log or integrated PO-receipt system is assumed to accrue missing supplier invoices easily; lacking this requires manual work or estimation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Period-End Manual"> <strong>Customer Acknowledgment — Bill & Hold (Exhibit 9.2)</strong><br>• Form elements: customer name;

It tells the organisation where money will be spent, when, and why. A high-quality budget reduces uncertainty by forcing managers to state assumptions explicitly: sales volumes, price strategies, hiring plans, production capacity, timing of capital projects, supplier terms, and collection/payment behavior. Good budgets act as a control mechanism. They are a pre-authorisation system for spending. Good budgets also are the primary instrument to discover mismatches between strategic ambition and available resources. They reveal cash shortfalls early and force choices—defer, re-scope, finance, or cut. The accountant’s role is synthesis. Gather inputs, model interactions, expose risks, and produce a coherent plan that can be monitored and enforced. This chapter lays out the architecture of an interlocking budget suite, sample worksheets, flex budgeting design, process improvements and control frameworks that ensure budgets are useful and auditable. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>System of interlocking budgets — architecture, logic & sequencing</strong><br>Budgets are not stand-alone spreadsheets. They form a network: changes in one ripple through others. Two starting points usually drive the rest: <strong>Revenue</strong> and <strong>Research & Development (R&D)</strong>.<br>• <strong>Revenue</strong> sets demand. It drives production volume, finished goods needs, material purchases and headcount for sales and production. It also drives variable selling costs such as commissions and logistics.<br>• <strong>R&D</strong> is discretionary and drives capital and staffing independent of sales arrival. It often competes with cash available for production capex and working capital. Financing constraints may force R&D reprioritisation.<br>Sequence and dependencies: revenue → production → purchasing → inventory → direct labor → overhead adjustments → departmental expense budgets (sales/marketing/G&A) → staffing & facilities → capital → consolidated income + cash flow → financing plan. At each stage include supporting worksheets, assumptions and capacity constraints (especially bottlenecks). Keep IDs and links across sheets so traceability is instantaneous. Example: each production SKU line must link back to revenue SKU ID, BOM ID, routing ID and cost driver IDs (labor hours, machine hours). Include periodicity alignment (monthly vs quarterly) and currency normalisation if multi-currency. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Revenue budget — detailed design & methods</strong><br>Design choices: choose level-of-detail that balances usefulness versus maintenance burden. Options: SKU-level (unit × price), product-line totals, or territory-level aggregations. For new product launches use phased ramp profiles rather than single-period jumps. Explicitly model selling terms (credit days, payment schedules) to feed cash forecasts.<br>Key inputs and validation steps:<br>1. Salesforce input: get bottom-up estimates from sales reps, territory managers and regional heads. Require documented assumptions (customer lists, campaigns, territory coverage).<br>2. Market & pricing assumptions: competitor behaviour, promotional cycles, seasonality factors, price elasticity assumptions.<br>3. Cross-checks: compare budgeted sales per salesperson to historical productivity and stated hiring/training timelines. Where hires are required, incorporate recruiting lag and training ramp to forecast sales impact.<br>4. Scenario lines: best case, base, downside. Maintain a 'consensus' base case used for consolidation.<br>5. Proportions: track quarter/period proportions and product mix to spot concentration risk.<br>Practical tip: require a small “supporting schedule” for each major line showing assumptions (units, average price, major customers) so auditors and managers can reproduce the number. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Inventory budget — targets, turnover & operational constraints</strong><br>Inventory is both strategic and tactical. Set turnover targets for raw materials, WIP and finished goods. Rationale: improved turnover reduces working capital but can raise stockout risk. Plan transitions (e.g., moving from 6 turns to 9 turns) as multi-period programs with explicit operational actions (JIT suppliers, MRP, safety stock recalibration).<br>Components: opening balances, targeted ending balances, required production, purchases and lead time buffers. Always state whether target is expressed as turns, days on hand or target safety stock. For manufacturing, align WIP levels with planned batch sizes and setup frequencies. Document scrap/obsolescence assumptions. For high-variance materials include alternate scenarios. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Production budget — capacity, bottlenecks, batch sizing & step-costs</strong><br>Production planning must reconcile demand with capacity. Key elements:<br>• <strong>Bottleneck identification:</strong> identify the slowest process (machine, tool or skilled labor) and calculate capacity vs demand. Model utilization and potential step-capacity investments.<br>• <strong>Batch sizing:</strong> smaller batches raise setup overhead, scrap risk and throughput loss; larger batches increase inventory. Model trade-offs and reflect on overhead allocations.<br>• <strong>Step costs:</strong> capture costs that jump when certain thresholds are crossed (e.g., additional shift, new supervisor). Explicitly note thresholds and add automated flags in the model when crossing occurs.<br>• <strong>Planned maintenance and downtime:</strong> schedule planned downtime and pre-build inventory for major shutdowns (e.g., install new tooling).<br>• <strong>Non-bottleneck constraints:</strong> ensure other processes and skillsets scale (materials handling, QA, secondary operations). Include cross-train ramp in staffing pages. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Purchasing budget — BOM-driven procurement & vendor strategy</strong><br>Purchasing translates planned production to buy orders. Practices:<br>• Use accurate bills of materials (BOMs). Always attach revision numbers and effective dates. Old BOMs cause under/overbuying. <br>• Include lead times and preferred supplier schedules. Model staggered purchases to match lot sizes and delivery cadence. <br>• Add scrap and yield factors in purchase quantities. <br>• For market-volatile commodities maintain best/worst price sensitivity lines. <br>• Consider supplier contracts, long-term agreements and volume discounts. If shifting to JIT, model increased delivery frequency and handling costs.<br>Vendor risk mitigations: keep supplier concentration metrics and budget a small contingency for supplier price spikes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Direct labor budget — routing-driven & semi-fixed behavior</strong><br>Direct labor often behaves semi-fixed: you keep staff for stable operations, not control them strictly to production swings. Model direct labor with:<br>• Labor routings per SKU producing required headcount per period.<br>• Fixed headcount lines for core teams and variable lines where overtime or temporary labor is expected.<br>• Union/contractual constraints, seniority-layoff rules, and step-rate increases.<br>• Efficiency ramps for new hires and learning curves; model a lower initial productivity and ramp to standard output.<br>• Payroll taxes, benefits, shift differentials and bonuses. Include these on a benefits & payroll tax schedule and link totals to departmental budgets and the COGS consolidation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Overhead budget — decomposition, valid ranges & drivers</strong><br>Overhead covers supervision, maintenance, materials management, quality, utilities, facilities, depreciation and small tools. Important practices:<br>• <strong>Valid capacity ranges:</strong> for each overhead block specify capacity ranges where budget assumptions hold (e.g., 40–70% utilization). If actual activity goes outside that range create alternate overhead scenarios.<br>• <strong>Driver-based allocation:</strong> where possible allocate overhead on rational drivers (machine hours, labor hours, floor area, number of shipments). Document allocation keys in a single mapping sheet for audit traceability.<br>• <strong>Step-down vs activity-based:</strong> for significant overheads prefer activity-based allocations to avoid distortion when production mix changes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) budget — product-level contributions</strong><br>Build a product-line COGS summary: revenue → materials → contribution margin → allocation of direct labor → contribution after labor → allocate overhead → gross margin. Provide contribution margin (%) per SKU or product line to support pricing and portfolio decisions. Keep a reconciliation schedule that links aggregate COGS in the income statement to detail lines in purchasing, direct labor and overhead worksheets. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Sales budget — headcount, territory economics & confidentiality</strong><br>Design options: departmental overhead block, expense per product-line, expense per salesperson or regional roll-ups. Choose format based on number of reps and confidentiality risk. Key considerations:<br>• <strong>Quota realism:</strong> match quotas to historical sales per rep and training ramp assumptions for new hires.<br>• <strong>Compensation modeling:</strong> separate salary, commission and bonuses so you can stress-test variable cost behavior.<br>• <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> avoid public distribution of per-salesperson compensation details. Use aggregated reporting for executives. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Marketing budget — campaign lifecycles & lag effects</strong><br>Marketing spend often precedes revenue impact. Best practice:<br>• Link campaign spend to expected response curves and lag windows (e.g., brand campaigns show results over many months). Model the delayed revenue impact to avoid misattributing marketing ROI to immediate periods.<br>• Include campaign-level KPIs (impressions, leads, conversion rates) and explanation columns for assumptions.<br>• For launches, budget disproportionately in early periods and provide a runway for customer adoption. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>General & Administrative (G&A) budget — cross-function effects</strong><br>G&A is a cost center but must scale with operations. Link G&A staffing to activity drivers: transaction volumes, headcount, number of sites, and capital projects. Include IT and automation capex where headcount reductions are targeted. Track G&A as % of revenue and set benchmarks. Preserve a governance note that G&A reductions often need one-time implementation capex or process redesign investments. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Staffing budget — aggregated positions & linking</strong><br>Create staffing by job family and quarter with average salary and overtime assumptions. Link staffing to payroll pages so changes update salary expense and benefits automatically. Keep a hiring timeline that maps required hires to lead time and training ramp. For headcount-related capex, multiply net new hires by the per-head capex standard (e.g., IT, furniture). Protect staffing sheets due to confidentiality. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Facilities budget — occupancy metrics & optimization</strong><br>Include contracted services, maintenance, utilities, insurance, repairs, property taxes and cleaning. Track square feet, sq ft per employee and unused sqft. Use these metrics to plan consolidation or sub-leasing. Link facilities to staffing: headcount changes affect facilities needs over time. Budget for infrequent large repairs separately and include timing uncertainty. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Research & development budget — project vs department</strong><br>Split R&D into departmental overhead and project-line budgets. For projects:<br>• Include milestone schedules and deliverable-linked cash flows.<br>• Rank projects by strategic fit and expected NPV or strategic option value.<br>• If financing constrained, prune lower-ranked projects and document rationale. Track patent filing plans and expected timing. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Capital budget — categories, scrutiny & scheduling</strong><br>Group capex: bottleneck-related (increase throughput), headcount-related (desks & laptops), profit-related (productivity or new revenue), safety/required (compliance), other. For profit-related capex perform discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis with the organisation’s hurdle rate. Evaluate interactions: ensure capex purchases actually increase bottleneck capacity if that is the goal. Plan procurement timelines to allow installation before project go-live dates. Include a small capital contingency. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Consolidated budgeted financial statements — income & cash flow design</strong><br>Consolidate budgets into scheduled income statements and cash flow. Include: revenue, materials, direct labor, overhead totals, operating expenses, depreciation, and net profit by period. For cash flow: start cash, net profit, add back depreciation, subtract capital outflows, add/subtract expected changes in AR/AP/inventory based on timing assumptions, then compute ending cash. Present scenarios with different collections and payment assumptions (e.g., base case DSO, faster collection, slower collection). Always cross-check that profit build ties back to individual budget sheets. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Cash forecast — timing precision & scenario planning</strong><br>Cash is the linchpin. Avoid optimistic collection assumptions. Build AR aging models and map budgeted sales into probable cash collection by period using historical DSO bands. For AP, model planned payment terms and include a supplier negotiation scenario where extended terms are agreed in advance. Monitor rolling cash forecasts and flag maximum shortfalls. Keep a financing plan ready showing amount, timing and cost alternatives. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Financing plan — options, cost of capital & impact analysis</strong><br>When a cash shortfall is identified, outline options: bank debt, asset-backed facilities, supplier financing, preferred equity, common equity. For each option state: amount, timing, required covenants, security, and cost. Compute revised weighted average cost of capital (WACC) including tax shield for debt. Evaluate impact on leverage ratios and covenant testing. Present sensitivity where financing costs change or required funding grows. Use financing choice to stress test future investment decisions (higher WACC increases capex hurdle rates). </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Flex budgeting — design patterns & examples</strong><br>Flex budgets make comparisons meaningful when activity differs from plan. Design approach:<br>1. Identify truly variable elements (materials, commissions, certain freight). Express them as formulas (percent of revenue or per-unit rates).<br>2. Identify semi-variable and step-costs. Model fixed base component + variable component, and clearly mark step thresholds.<br>3. Keep flex logic in a central pivot or control sheet. If ERP cannot handle, keep flex in linked spreadsheet with clear mapping to GL accounts.<br>4. For reporting, show: original static budget, flexed budget at actual activity, actuals, and variance (actual vs flex budget). This isolates controllable variances from volume-driven ones. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Budget process — traditional flow & friction points</strong><br>Traditional route is iterative and frequently late. Friction arises from: late inputs, too much detail, inadequate version control, low discipline on cut-offs, and lack of clear ownership. Typical iterative loop: strategic targets → revenue bottoms-up inputs → production planning → purchasing & inventory → departmental expense updates → consolidated P&L & cash → management review → rework. Each cycle may require reset of assumptions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Streamlining the budget — tactical best practices</strong><br>Adopt these practical moves to compress cycle time and improve quality:<br>• <strong>Trim accounts:</strong> reduce GL lines used in budgeting to necessary items only. Fewer lines = less data entry and fewer reconciliation points.<br>• <strong>Quarterly base with monthly roll-forward:</strong> keep quarter-level budget to reduce detail, and automatically split to months for reporting if needed.<br>• <strong>Single control sheet of variables:</strong> inflation, wage escalation, tax rates, commodity price indexes and FX rates. Link all sheets to these variables. Show instant sensitivity. Color-code linked fields to avoid accidental overwrites.<br>• <strong>Pre-built templates by owner:</strong> give budget owners standard templates with input-only cells. Protect formula areas. Include a short training pack. <br>• <strong>Automate validation checks:</strong> totals match, required IDs present, percent-of-revenue fields within expected bands, missing tax IDs flagged. Build a list of pre-flight checks before accepting inputs.<br>• <strong>Flag step-cost triggers automatically:</strong> when a production volume or headcount threshold is crossed, show required approvals for larger expense categories. <br>• <strong>Rank capital projects:</strong> create a project-ranking matrix (strategic score, NPV, payback, capex required). Allow the model to automatically deselect projects when a cash cap is exceeded. <br>• <strong>Senior-management digest:</strong> create a one-page summary dashboard with key metrics and top 5 risks. This reduces time for top-level decision-making. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Budgetary control systems — enforcement & technology integration</strong><br>Link budget to purchasing systems. Controls include:<br>• <strong>PO blocking</strong>: prevent POs exceeding budget or cumulative appropriation. Use tolerance percentages or quarterly comparisons to avoid operational disruption. <br>• <strong>Approvals & escalation workflows:</strong> automatic routing when variance thresholds are breached. <br>• <strong>Automated reports</strong>: departmental variance reports, cash runway reports, KPIs and aging schedules distributed to budget owners. <br>• <strong>Role-based access:</strong> restrict edit rights to owners; provide read-only dashboards for other stakeholders.<br>• <strong>Integration opportunities:</strong> connect payroll/HROS to budget, procurement to purchasing plan, and bank feeds to cash forecasts. Automation reduces reconciliation time and errors. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Variance analysis — methods & investigation playbook</strong><br>Good variance analysis isolates cause: price vs volume vs mix vs efficiency vs timing. Recommended framework:<br>1. Start with actual vs flex-budget variance. Identify volume-driven variances first. <br>2. Decompose remaining variance into price (per unit), cost (per unit), and mix effects. <br>3. For labor, compare actual hours and rates to standard. For materials, compare usage and purchase price variances. <br>4. Create a standard exceptions register: threshold for investigation, owner, root cause, and remediation. Track until closure. <br>5. Link significant variances back to the budget assumptions and, if systemic, update the next budget cycle’s assumptions. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Using budgets to detect fraud & mismanagement</strong><br>Budgets help surface anomalies. Methods:<br>• Trend and ratio analytics: watch for sudden jumps in small accounts, repeated manual adjustments, round-number spikes and duplicate invoices. <br>• Exception alerts: automated notifications when transactions exceed normal bounds or budgets are edited outside control windows. <br>• Periodic surprise reconciliations and sample testing on payroll and vendor files. <br>• Conduct periodic analytics for odd vendor bank account patterns and duplicate payees. Note limitations: long-running fraud that has been “baked into” historical budgets may not show as a variance. Use audits, forensic reviews and whistleblower channels for deeper investigation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>KPIs & performance metrics — recommended set</strong><br>Core budgeting KPIs to monitor health:<br>• Cycle time for budget completion.<br>• % budget inputs submitted on time.<br>• % of budget lines with explanatory notes/assumptions.<br>• Budget accuracy (variance vs flex budget) aggregated by materiality bands.<br>• Cash runway days and maximum projected shortfall.<br>• G&A as % of revenue.<br>• Inventory turns.<br>• Revenue per full-time employee.<br>• Capex on-time & on-budget rate.<br>• Time to resolve budget exceptions. Track trends monthly and target continuous improvement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Templates & repository — naming, version control & access</strong><br>Standard templates to maintain: revenue workbook, production plan, BOM and purchasing, direct labor routings, benefits & payroll tax page, overhead templates, departmental expense templates, staffing plan, facilities, research project ledger, capital project forms, consolidated income and cash flow, financing schedule, and audit pack index.<br>Repository and governance:<br>• One protected central repository with role-based permissions. <br>• Version control: include version ID, preparer, reviewer and timestamp inside file header. <br>• Naming convention example: <code>Budget_&lt;YYYY&gt;_&lt;Entity&gt;_&lt;Workbook&gt;_v01_&lt;YYYYMMDD&gt;.xlsx</code>.<br>• Retention: keep archived annual budgets and audit pack as required by local law and internal policy. An index or metadata sheet speeds auditor navigation. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Auditability & audit pack contents</strong><br>Prepare an indexed audit pack containing: main control sheet, revenue support (customer lists, pricing assumptions), sample sales contracts, payroll/benefits schedule, sample payslips and employment contracts for sampled staff, timesheet/effort reports, statutory remittance proofs (if relevant), bank advices for major payments, GL upload previews and reconciliation, purchasing vendor confirmations for capex, capital project evaluations, approvals and authorization sign-offs, variance explanations for major movements, SOC reports for outsourced providers, access logs for budget files, and issue logs from prior audits. Provide cross-reference tables to make sampling efficient for auditors. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Governance & approval thresholds</strong><br>Define explicit thresholds and evidence required for adjustments: e.g., minor adjustments (< $500) approved by budget manager; moderate adjustments ($500–5,000) require CFO sign-off; high value adjustments (> $5,000) require CEO + CFO + HR/legal where relevant. For capital projects adopt a formal capex approval committee with written ROI and impact analysis. Keep escalation paths and timelines documented. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Implementation checklist — immediate & medium-term actions</strong><br>Immediate (0–3 months): publish budget calendar and strict cut-offs; centralize control variables and lock down protected cells; distribute standard templates and training guides; reconcile the latest live run to GL & bank; run sample contract to actual checks for top pay lines; establish an audit pack checklist.<br>Medium-term (3–12 months): reduce and rationalise budget accounts; implement automated validation checks; connect payroll and HROS to the budget; create step-cost flagging logic; set up capital project ranking and automatic selection under cash caps; automate recurring management reports and exception alerts; run an external payroll/budget health-check. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Common errors, root causes & mitigations</strong><br>Common errors:<br>• Unrealistic revenue assumptions.<br>• Failure to include ramp-up times for hires and training.<br>• Missing step-costs and thresholds.<br>• Over-optimistic AR collection timing and late-payment reliance to solve cash needs.<br>• Inadequate documentation for manual adjustments.<br>Mitigations: base assumptions on historical periods and conservatively stress test; mandate supporting schedules for material drivers; publish and enforce a budget timeline; require sign-offs for manual adjustments and retain supporting evidence; use flex budget comparisons for performance measurement. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Donor-funded & restricted funds considerations</strong><br>For donor-funded projects treat apportionments and effort reporting carefully. Keep donor mapping sheets linking payroll cost elements to award budget lines. Retain effort reports, signed timesheets and budget-holder approvals as evidence for donor auditors. Flag donor-ineligible costs and maintain a watch list of any recharges that might be ineligible under specific award terms. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Third-party processing & outsourcing controls</strong><br>If payroll or budgeting elements are outsourced, require SLA, confidentiality/data protection clauses, SOC reports or security attestations, monthly reconciliations and audit access. Maintain a register of providers, backup arrangements, data return clauses and periodic control attestations. Country office remains responsible for statutory compliance even if processing is outsourced. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Special cases & remote/cash handling</strong><br>Cash payroll or remote distributions only when unavoidable. Controls: two-person custody, pre-numbered receipts, ID verification, witness signatures, immediate reconciliation to bank or payroll control. Emergency payments require authorisation and retrospective documentation. For remote/mobile payments document provider controls and data protection safeguards. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Training, capacity building & continuous improvement</strong><br>Budget training should be role-specific. Preparer training emphasises spreadsheet discipline, formulas, version control, and validation checks. Reviewer training focuses on analytical checks, KPI interpretation and audit evidence expectations. Run tabletop scenarios (cash shortfall, vendor failure) and document lessons learned. Schedule annual refresher training and update SOPs after system or legal changes. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Decision support & management reporting</strong><br>Provide a concise management dashboard with: top three risks, cash runway, net profit by scenario, top 10 variances with explanations, capital project status, and recommended financing alternatives. For senior management keep explanations short and data-driven. Provide drilldowns for analysts and auditors. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Model maintenance & lifecycle governance</strong><br>Design models for change: central variables sheet, modular workbooks, named ranges, and a change log. Freeze final budget and only allow changes through a controlled change request process. Archive versions and maintain a single source of truth for the approved budget. Reconcile ledger postings back to budget lines monthly. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Practical narrative: building one consolidated budget — step-by-step</strong><br>1. <strong>Set the time horizon and format</strong> (quarterly or monthly).<br>2. <strong>Define strategy priorities</strong> and list them in the budget header so reviewers know the trade-offs. <br>3. <strong>Collect revenue inputs from sales</strong> with supporting evidence and write-ups. <br>4. <strong>Run production planning</strong> to convert revenue into units and determine bottleneck capacity. <br>5. <strong>Prepare purchasing schedules</strong> from BOMs and lead times. <br>6. <strong>Prepare direct labor & overhead</strong> based on routings, headcount and valid capacity ranges. <br>7. <strong>Assemble departmental budgets</strong> (sales, marketing, G&A, research, facilities). <br>8. <strong>Prepare capital projects</strong> and rank them by strategic score and NPV. <br>9. <strong>Consolidate income statement</strong> and generate cash flow using realistic AR/AP timing. <br>10. <strong>Identify funding gap</strong> and present financing options with revised WACC. <br>11. <strong>Run sensitivity</strong> on key assumptions (sales, gross margin, DSO) and prepare an executive summary. <br>12. <strong>Review cycles</strong>: run 2–3 iterations with management and fix the final budgets. <br>13. <strong>Lock down and publish</strong> the approved budget with a controlled distribution list. </td></tr><tr><td data-label="Budgeting Manual"> <strong>Longer narrative — how choices distort budgets (examples)</strong><br>Example 1: Senior management mandates a 20% revenue uplift without consulting sales. Result: unrealistic quotas, overstretched production capacity, inflated raw material orders leading to unused inventory, and a higher cash need. Fix: require written sales validation and staged ramping. <br>Example 2: Marketing underfunds a product launch expecting immediate sales. Result: shortfall in expected sales and inventory build that misses the launch window. Fix: fund marketing runway and model lagged revenue. <br>Example 3: Relying on extended AP to cover cash shortfalls. Result: supplier relationship damage, late fees and supply risk.

High-quality budgets enforce discipline, clarify trade-offs, and make cash constraints visible. Immediate wins: centralise variables, trim accounts, require supporting schedules for material lines, introduce flex-budget comparisons and implement a single-sheet senior summary. Medium-term wins: integrate payroll & procurement systems to reduce manual uploads, automate validation checks and implement capital ranking logic. For auditors: retain an indexed audit pack and versioned assumptions. For management: provide short, evidence-backed summaries and scenario outputs. For implementers: document every assumption and maintain change logs. The result: a budgeting process that is faster, more credible and auditable. </td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="row-count">Rows: 42</div></div><div class="table-caption" id="Table5" data-table="Docu_0157_05" style="margin-top:2mm;margin-left:3mm;"><strong>Table 5</strong></div>
